 Overview of Currency Management Processes | 6 

## Overview of Currency Management Processes 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain companies that perform multicurrency accounting. By using this multicurrency functionality, you can enter transactions in different currencies and maintain the history of transactions in both the base currency and the currency of the transactions. 

 The main processes related to currency management are described in this topic. 

#### Configuring Currencies 

 In Acumatica ERP, you specify the base currency—the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company generates and expends cash—when you create the first company on the Companies (CS101500) form. 

 You can edit the settings of any currency in the system used for accounting and reporting purposes. For details, see the Multicurrency Functionality chapter. 

#### Managing Currency Rates 

 Acumatica ERP supports an unlimited number of currency rate types. You can assign different rate types to vendors and customers that use the same foreign currency. You can update exchange rates as frequently as you need, and historical currency rates are stored in the database for all previous financial years. You can set up the process of refreshing the currency rates by using the Open Exchange Rates API online service. For more information, see the Currency Rate Types and Current Rates chapter. 

#### Managing Translations 

 If your company prepares reports in a currency other than the base currency, you can set up translations to accurately reflect your business operations in another currency. For more information, see the Translation of Financial Statements: General Information chapter. 

#### Managing Revaluations 

 You can maintain any general ledger accounts you select in foreign currencies. At the end of each financial period, you have to revalue in the base currency the balances of general ledger accounts that are denominated to foreign currencies. The revaluation gains and losses are calculated automatically, with the appropriate adjustments posted to the revaluation gain and loss accounts specified for each foreign currency. 

 You can maintain operations with selected vendors and customers in foreign currencies. At the end of each financial period, you have to revalue all open accounts payable and accounts receivable documents in the base currency. The revaluation gains and losses are calculated automatically, and the appropriate adjusting and reversing batches are generated. 

 For detailed information, see Revaluation of AP Documents: General Information , Revaluation of AR Documents: General Information , and Revaluation of Bank Accounts: General Information.

## Processing Funds Transfers in Foreign Currencies 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to process a funds transfer in a foreign currency. 

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can record cash transfers in foreign currencies from one bank account to another, or between cash accounts that are linked to the same GL account and represent the same bank account. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 You will learn how to record a funds transfer in a foreign currency between cash accounts. 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You record a funds transfer when you need to redistribute funds in foreign currencies between different companies or branches of your organization. You can also move funds from one bank account to another—for example, when you want to deposit funds from one of the company's checking accounts to a savings account. 

#### Processing of a Funds Transfer 

 To process a funds transfer, you first create it on the Funds Transfers (CA301000) form. Then you release the transfer on any of the following forms: 

- _Funds Transfers_ (CA301000): You release the funds transfer you are viewing by clicking **Release** on the form     toolbar. 

- _Release Cash Transactions_ (CA502000): You use this form to release a particular funds transfer or multiple     funds transfers. On this form, funds transfers have the _Transfer_ type, and transactions that correspond to the     same transfer have the same transaction number. To release all transactions of a particular funds transfer,     you need to select only one transaction of the funds transfer by selecting the unlabeled check box in the row     of the transaction; you then release it by clicking **Release** on the form toolbar. The system releases the other     transactions of the funds transfer automatically. 

- _Cash Account Details_ (CA303000): You can use this form to release a particular funds transfer or multiple     funds transfers. On this form, you first select the cash account that is the source account or destination     account of your funds transfer, and then the system displays a list of transactions that includes the funds     transfer transaction of the _Transfer Out_ or _Transfer In_ type, depending on whether the account you selected     is a source account or destination account. To release all transactions of the funds transfer, you need to     select only one transaction of the funds transfer by selecting the unlabeled check box in the row of the     transaction; you then click **Release** on the form toolbar. The system releases the other transactions of the     funds transfer automatically. During processing, a funds transfer can have the following statuses. 

 Table: Statuses of Funds Transfers 

 Status Description 

 On Hold The transfer is being edited and cannot be released. 

 Balanced The transfer is balanced and can be released. 

 Released The transfer has been released.

#### Currency Conversion in Funds Transfers 

 If you transfer funds between accounts denominated in different currencies, the system performs currency conversion by using the base currency and the cash-in-transit account and subaccount (if subaccounts are in use in your system) that are specified in the Cash-In-Transit Account and Cash-In-Transit Subaccount boxes on the Cash Management Preferences (CA101000) form. 

 For transfers maintained in different currencies, you can change the exchange rate for a particular transfer, and you can change the amount received to the destination account if the exchange rate of the system differs from the exchange rate of the bank. If you change the received amount, the system calculates the realized gain or loss (RGOL) for the transfer. 

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for performing funds transfers in a foreign currency, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially perform funds transfers, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Settings to Check Note 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Chart of Accounts (GL202500) Check whether the necessary accounts have been created. 

 Cash Accounts (CA202000) Check whether the necessary cash accounts have been configured. 

 For details on configuring a cash account in a foreign currency, see Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an Account 

 Company Financial Calendar (GL201100) 

 Make sure that the periods during which funds transfers may occur have a status of Open. 

 You can generate the necessary periods on the Master Financial Calendar (GL201000) form. 

 For details on opening financial periods, see Opening Financial Periods: Process Activity. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AR invoice has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates.

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of configuring foreign currency cash accounts by specifying additional settings on the Cash Management Preferences (CA101000) form as follows: 

- To cause transactions to be posted to the general ledger when cash documents are released, select the     **Automatically Post to GL on Release** check box. If this check box is cleared, you have to post the batch     aer you release the document. 

- To cause new transactions and funds transfers to be assigned the _Balanced_ status when they are     entered, clear the **Hold Transactions on Entry** check box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If the **Hold**     **Transactions on Entry** check box is cleared, the transactions and funds transfers are assigned the _On Hold_     status. 

- To make filling in the **Document Ref.** box on the _Funds Transfers_ (CA301000) form mandatory for new funds     transfers, select the **Require Document Ref. Nbr. on Entry** check box. If this check box is cleared, you can     leave the **Document Ref.** box blank. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you perform funds transfers in a foreign currency by performing instructions similar to those described in Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Process Activity. 

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Generated Transactions 

 The system always generates separate GL transactions for a multicurrency transfer. The following tables show the transactions recorded to the general ledger for the source and destination accounts. 

 Table: Transactions for Source Account: Multicurrency Transfer 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Source account 0.00 Transfer amount 

 Cash-in-Transit account Transfer amount 0.00 

 Table: Transactions for the Destination Account: Multicurrency Transfer 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Destination account Transfer amount 0.00 

 Cash-in-Transit account 0.00 Transfer amount 

 If a gain or loss is produced by a multicurrency transfer, the transactions shown in the following tables are recorded to the general ledger for the destination account, depending on whether a gain or loss is produced by the transfer— that is, whether the realized gain or loss (RGOL) is positive or negative.

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Process Activity 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of performing a funds transfer in a foreign currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 30, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams needs to transfer C$484 to its new cash account to be able to make payments to vendors. The amount transferred from the 10200WH (Wholesale Checking) account is $379 (in USD ), and the amount received to the 10215WH (Checking Account CAD) is C$484.21, as reported by the bank. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to process the cash transfer in the system. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _10500 (Cash in Transit)_ account has been created. 

- On the _Cash Accounts_ (CA202000) form, the _10200WH (Wholesale Checking)_ bank account has been     predefined. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Funds Transfers in Foreign Currencies | 11 

#### Process Overview 

 On the Funds Transfers (CA301000) form, you will record a funds transfer in the amount of C$500.58 from the 10200WH cash account to the 10215WH cash account. You will then review the GL transactions generated by the system on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. Finally, you will review the balance of the 10215 GL account on the Account Details (GL404000) form. 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, do the following: 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the _U100_ dataset preloaded, and sign in as an accountant Anna     Johnson by using the _johnson_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the     business date in your system is set to _1/30/2026_. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu     button, and select _1/30/2026_ from the calendar. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all     documents in the system during this business date. 

3. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that     the _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

4. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 

5. Make sure that you have configured an account as described in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an_     _Account_. 

#### Step 1: Recording a Funds Transfer 

 To record a funds transfer, do the following: 

1. Open the _Funds Transfers_ (CA301000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** and in the **Description** box, enter Transfer 484 CAD. 

3. In the **Source Account** section, specify the following settings: 

- **Account** : _10200WH (Wholesale Checking)_ 

- **Transfer Date** : _1/30/2026_ (inserted by default) 

- **Document Ref.** : 1302026 

- **Amount** : 379 

4. In the **Destination Account** section, specify the following settings: 

- **Account** : _10215WH (Checking Account CAD)_     You created this cash account in the _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an Account_ prerequisite     activity. 

- **Receipt Date** : _1/30/2026_ (inserted by default) 

- **Document Ref.** : 1302026 (inserted automatically) 

- **Amount** : _484.21_ (inserted automatically)     The amount transferred from the _10200WH_ account is $379 in the base currency. Based on the effective     currency rate, the transferred amount is C$484.21. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Funds Transfers in Foreign Currencies | 12 

 Before you release the funds transfer, you could click the Exchange Rate box (right of the Currency box) in the Source Account section; in the Rate Selection dialog box, which opens, you can override the currency rate for this particular document. If the source account is denominated to a foreign currency, the exchange rate in the Source Account section (also in the Exchange Rate box right of the Currency box) can be overridden as well. 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the funds transfer.     When the system transfers amounts, it creates and releases two GL batches, one for each currency. 

#### Step 2: Reviewing the Generated GL Transactions 

 To review the GL transactions generated for each currency, do the following: 

1. While you are still on the _Funds Transfers_ (CA301000) form viewing the funds transfer you recorded, in the     **Source Account** section, click the link in the **Batch Number** box. 

2. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the transaction.     The batch was created in the base currency, because the _10200WH (Wholesale Checking)_ account is     denominated to the base currency. 

3. On the _Funds Transfers_ form, in the **Destination Account** section, click the link in the **Batch Number** box to     open the batch that was generated when the transfer to the _10215_ GL account was received. 

4. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the transaction in the base and foreign     currencies. (To toggle between the base and foreign currency, click the **View Base** or **View Cury** button right     of the **Currency** box.)     The accounts are maintained in different currencies, so the system performs the currency conversion by     using the cash-in-transit account. The following actions were performed when the system released the     transaction: 

- The destination account ( _10215_ ) was debited in the transfer amount (C$484.21, which is $379.00 based     on the current exchange rate). 

- The cash-in-transit account ( _10500_ ) was credited in the amount of the transfer out (C$484.21). 

#### Step 3: Reviewing the Balance of the Account 

 To review the balance of 10215 (Checking Account CAD) , do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Details_ (GL404000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Period Range** : _01-2026_ to _01-2026_ 

- **Account** : _10215 (Checking Account CAD)_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Selected 

3. Review the funds transfer in the table and the ending balance of the _10215_ account in the foreign currency     and the base currency. 

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Mass Processing 

 This topic explains how to release multiple funds transfers at once. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Funds Transfers in Foreign Currencies | 13 

#### Mass Release of Funds Transfers 

 You can release multiple funds transfers as follows: 

- _Release Cash Transactions_ (CA502000): You use this form to release a particular funds transfer or multiple     funds transfers. On this form, funds transfers have the _Transfer_ type, and transactions that correspond to     the same transfer have the same transaction number. To release transactions that belong to multiple funds     transfers at once, you need to select only one transaction for each funds transfer by selecting the unlabeled     check box in the row of the transaction and release it by clicking **Release** on the form toolbar; the system     releases the other transactions of the relevant funds transfers automatically. Alternatively, you can release     all transactions by clicking **Release All** on the form toolbar. 

- _Cash Account Details_ (CA303000): You can use this form to release a particular funds transfer or multiple     funds transfers. On this form, you first select a cash account, which can be a source account or a destination     account for your funds transfer, then the system displays a list of transactions that includes the funds     transfer transaction of the _Transfer Out_ or _Transfer In_ type, depending on whether the account you selected     is a source or destination account. To release transactions tat belong to multiple funds transfers, you need     to select only one transaction by selecting the unlabeled check box in the row of the transaction and release     it by clicking **Release** on the form toolbar; the system releases the other transactions automatically. 

### Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Related Report and Forms 

 In the following sections, you can find details about the report and forms you may want to review to gather information about multicurrency funds transfers. 

 If you do not see a particular report or form that is described, you may have signed in to the system with a user account that does not have access rights to the report or form. Contact your system administrator to obtain access to any needed reports or forms. 

#### Reviewing Funds Transfer Details 

 On the Funds Transfers (CA301000) form, you can review the details of any funds transfer and the associated GL transactions (if the funds transfer has been released) by clicking the batch numbers in the Source Account and Destination Account sections. 

#### Reviewing Activity on Cash Accounts 

 On the Cash Account Details (CA303000) form, you can view all activity on any cash account during the date range you specify, including any transactions of funds transfers generated for the selected cash account. 

#### Reviewing Transactions Generated on Release of Funds Transfers 

 For a particular financial period, you can review transactions in a foreign currency that were generated on release of a funds transfer if you run the Transactions for Period (GL633000) report with the Include Foreign Currency Details check box selected on the report form.

 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 14 

## Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to process an AR invoice in a foreign currency. 

### AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, multicurrency functionality is supported for AR documents. The system recalculates all transactions made in a foreign currency to the company's base currency. To record the difference resulting from rounding during currency conversion, the system uses the rounding gain and loss accounts specified for the document currency on the Currencies (CM202000) form. The small amount resulting from the currency rounding may be posted as a debit or a credit, depending on its sign. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create and process an invoice in a foreign currency 

- Override the default currency rate 

- Pay the invoice with a payment in the same foreign currency 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You process invoices in a foreign currency if your foreign customers need to receive invoices in their own currency, which differs from the base currency in your system. If you have a cash account in the foreign currency used by your customers, you may want to receive payments for the invoices in this currency. 

#### Processing of an Invoice in a Foreign Currency 

 In AR documents, the system uses the currency settings of the customer that is specified in the document. The currency settings are the currency, currency rate type, currency override ability, and currency rate override ability. When you create a customer on the Customers (AR303000) form, the system inserts the currency settings of the customer class by default. If needed, you can override the default currency settings. 

 To recalculate the document amounts in the base currency, the system uses the currency exchange rate that was effective on the date of the document unless the rate is overridden in the document. The GL transaction posted to the general ledger on release of the document and the document itself can be reviewed in two currencies: the base currency and the document currency. 

 The RGOL amount calculated when a payment or credit memo is applied to an invoice is processed as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive (which means that the application of the document produces a     gain), the realized gain account associated with the invoice currency is credited in the RGOL amount. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative (which means that the application of the document produces a     loss), the realized loss account associated with the invoice currency is debited in the amount of (–1) *     RGOL. 

#### Formula to Calculate Realized Gains and Losses 

 If a payment is issued in the same foreign currency as the currency of the document, the realized gain or loss is calculated in the base currency as the difference in exchange rates multiplied by the payment amount. The following formula is used. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 15 

 RGOL Amount = Round (Payment Amount * Payment Rate) – Round (Payment Amount * Document Rate) 

 That is, the system calculates the realized gain or loss as the payment amount it converts into the base currency by using the payment rate minus the payment amount the system converts into the base currency by using the invoice rate. Round () indicates that the amount within parentheses is rounded to the decimal precision that is set for the base currency in the Summary area of the Currencies (CM202000) form. 

#### Changing of the Cross Rate 

 When applying a payment to a multicurrency invoice, you can change the cross rate along with the application, if needed. 

 For instance, suppose you had issued an invoice in a foreign currency, and then you received a payment in this foreign currency. Your company does not have a bank account in the foreign currency, and the bank used some currency rate to translate the payment amount to the currency of your bank account. In this case, you record the payment to a cash account that represents your bank account and apply it to the invoice. The rate used by the bank may differ from the rate you used to record the invoice. To make the payment amount and the invoice amount equal, you can adjust the rate in the Cross Rate column for the applied invoice. When you release the payment and its applications, the balance of the realized gain or loss (RGOL) account is updated by the amount resulting from the difference in the exchange rates used to record the invoice and the payment. 

 If your company has a bank account in the foreign currency (so there is a cash account in the system that represents this bank account), you record the payment in a foreign currency to this cash account. When you release the payment and its applications, the balance of the RGOL account is updated by the amount resulting from the difference in the exchange rate on the invoice date and the payment application date. 

### AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing AR invoices in a foreign currency, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially process AR invoices in a foreign currency, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Customers (AR303000) Make sure that the customer accounts for the customers for which you will create AR documents have been defined. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 16 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AR document has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing AR invoices in a foreign currency by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AR transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear     the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system consolidates     into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents     being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Receivable Preferences_ (AR101000) form: 

- To cause all created AR invoices to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check     box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AR invoices are assigned     the _On Hold_ status. 

- To make entering a payment reference number in the **Payment Ref.** box mandatory when creating a     payment on the _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form, select the **Require Payment Reference**     **on Entry** check box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is cleared, you can leave the     **Payment Ref.** box empty when creating a payment. 

- To cause AR invoices to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process AR invoices in a foreign currency by performing instructions similar to those described in AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity. 

### AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: Generated Transactions 

 To be able to process an AR invoice in a foreign currency, you create and process an invoice and a payment. To update customer balances, the system generates the GL transactions described in the following sections. 

#### Transaction Generated for an AR Invoice 

 When you create and release a one-line AR invoice, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account Amount 0.00 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 17 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Sales Revenue account 0.00 Amount 

 Rounding Gain/Loss account Rounding loss amount Rounding gain amount 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

#### Transactions Generated for an Invoice Payment 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency and the currency rate of the payment is greater than that of the invoice, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account Amount + realized gain amount 0.00 

 Accounts Receivable account 0.00 Amount 

 Realized Gain account 0.00 Realized gain amount 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency and the currency rate of the payment is less than that of the invoice, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account Amount – realized loss amount 0.00 

 Accounts Receivable account 0.00 Amount 

 Realized Loss account Realized loss amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. 

### AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity 

 The following activity will walk you through the processing of an AR invoice in a foreign currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 30, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams provided juicer installation services to the Mint Store customer, whose currency is the Canadian dollar ( CAD ), and issued an invoice in CAD. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to create the invoice in the system and apply a payment in the same foreign currency to this invoice. Before you perform these actions, you will make changes to the Mint Store customer’s settings so that invoice processing can be performed in line with the customer’s currency-related preferences. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 18 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _11000 (Accounts Receivable)_ , _40000 (Sales Revenue)_ , and _42010_     _(Realized Gain CAD)_ accounts have been created. 

- On the _Customer Classes_ (AR201000) form, the _INTLCA (Canadian Customers)_ customer class has been     predefined. 

- On the _Customers_ (AR303000) form, the _MINTSTORE_ customer has been predefined. 

- On the _Payment Methods_ (CA204000) form, the _WIRE_ payment method for wire transfers has been created. 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, you will update the customer’s currency-related settings on the Customers (AR303000) form to prepare the customer for multicurrency invoice processing, and update the settings of the payment method on the Payment Methods (CA204000) form. On the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you will then create an invoice in CAD and override the rate manually for this particular invoice. You will then post the invoice and review the GL transaction generated by the system on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. To review the customer's balance, you will run the AR Balance by Customer MC (AR633000) report. Finally, on the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, you will pay the invoice in the same currency ( CAD ). 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, do the following: 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the _U100_ dataset preloaded, and sign in as an accountant Anna     Johnson by using the _johnson_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the     business date in your system is set to _1/30/2026_. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu     button, and select _1/30/2026_ from the calendar. 

3. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that     the _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

4. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 

5. Make sure that you have configured an account as described in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an_     _Account_. 

#### Step 1: Updating the Customer’s Settings 

 To update the currency-related customer settings in preparation for multicurrency invoice processing, do the following: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 19 

1. Open the _Customers_ (AR303000) form. 

2. In the **Customer ID** box, select _MINTSTORE_. 

3. On the **Financial** tab ( **Financial Settings** section), do the following: 

- In the **Currency ID** box, select _CAD_.     This is the primary currency to be inserted in invoices and memos for this customer. 

- Notice that the **Curr. Rate Type** box is empty, which is the default value of this setting copied from the     customer class.     This setting specifies the currency rate type to be used for the customer. Because you are not specifying a     **Curr. Rate Type** value for the customer, the system will use the _SPOT_ rate, which is set as the default rate     for accounts receivable on the _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form. 

- Notice that the **Enable Currency Override** check box is cleared, which is the default state of this check     box from the customer class.     With this check box cleared, you cannot override the currency in the invoices and memos to this     customer—that is, the setting in the **Currency ID** box specifies the only currency that can be used in     documents for this customer. 

 Select this check box if you need to issue invoices and memos to a customer in a currency other than the default one in certain situations. 

- Select the **Enable Rate Override** check box.     With this check box selected, you can override the rate type and exchange rate in documents created for     this customer. 

4. On the **Payment Methods** tab, for the _WIRE_ method, select the **Is Default** check box. 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Save** to save your changes. 

#### Step 2: Reviewing the Payment Method Settings 

 To review the settings of the payment method for the foreign currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Payment Methods_ (CA204000) form. 

2. In the **Payment Method ID** box, select _WIRE_. 

3. On the **Allowed Cash Accounts** tab, make sure that _10215WH (Checking Account CAD)_ is listed, and the **Use**     **in AP** and **Use in AR** check boxes are selected.     You associated this payment method with the _10215WH_ cash account and selected these check boxes when     you created the account in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an Account_. 

#### Step 3: Creating and Releasing an Invoice 

 To create and release an invoice in the CAD currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Invoice_ 

- **Customer** : _MINTSTORE_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ (inserted automatically when you selected the customer)     The _CAD_ currency is selected in the invoice (and the document amounts are specified in _CAD_ ) because     you specified this currency for the customer. The currency of the invoice cannot be overridden because     the **Enable Currency Override** check box is cleared for the customer on the **Financial** tab of the     _Customers_ (AR303000) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 20 

- **Date** : _1/30/2026_ (inserted automatically)     If you were to override the date, the currency rate in the document changes, because the system uses the     effective rate on the selected date. 

- **Post Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Description** : Juicer installation 

3. On the **Details** tab, click **Add Row** , and in the added row, specify the following settings: 

- **Transaction Descr.** : Installation 

- **Ext. Price** : 300.01 

4. Add another row, and specify the following settings: 

- **Transaction Descr.** : Business travel 

- **Ext. Price** : 150.01 

5. In the Summary area, click the Exchange Rate box (right of the **Currency** box), and review the **Rate**     **Selection** dialog box, which opens.     The **Curr. Rate Type ID** ( _SPOT_ ) is the default rate type determined by the **AR Rate Type** setting on the     _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form, because you haven't specified a rate type for the     customer. The system uses the currency rate that became effective on 1/30/2026. You can override the rate     type and rate in this document because the **Enable Rate Override** check box is selected for the customer on     the _Customers_ form. 

 Any time you need to check which currency rate was effective on a particular date, on the Currency Rates (CM301000) form, you can select the needed date in the Effective Date box and review the Effective Currency Rates tab. 

6. Click **OK** to close the **Rate Selection** dialog box. 

7. In the Summary area, click the **View Base** button (right of the **Currency** box) to review the invoice amounts     in the base currency ( _USD_ ).     For converting the invoice total and line amounts, the system uses the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ rate that was effective on     the invoice date. The system computes the detail total and the line amounts in the base currency as follows: 

- $352.24 ( **Detail Total** of the document) = Round (C$450.02 * 0.78271760) 

- $234.82 ( **Amount** of the first line) = Round (C$300.01 * 0.78271760) 

- $117.42 ( **Amount** of the second line) = Round (C$150.01 * 0.78271760) 

 When you are reviewing the document in the base currency, you cannot modify the document amounts. To be able to modify invoice amounts, you would have to switch back to viewing the document currency of the invoice by clicking View Cury. 

8. Click **View Cury** to return to the document currency. 

9. Click the Exchange Rate box (right of the **Currency** box), and in the **Rate Selection** dialog box (which     opens), enter 0.735 as the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ rate. 

10.Click **OK** to confirm the rate changes and close the dialog box. 

11.In the Summary area, click **View Base** , and review the invoice amounts in the base currency. 

 The Detail Total in the base currency is $330.76, because the system recalculated the amount by using the exchange rate that you have specified manually (C$450.02 * 0.735). The system also recalculated the line amounts in the base currency by using the new rate; now they are $220.51 for the first line and $110.26 for the second line. This manually specified currency rate is used in this particular invoice only and does not override the effective currency rate of the SPOT type that is specified on the Currency Rates form. 

12.On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the invoice. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 21 

#### Step 4: Reviewing the Generated GL Transaction 

 To review the GL transaction generated by the system, do the following: 

1. While you are still on the _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form, on the **Financial** tab, click the link in the     **Batch Nbr.** box. 

2. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated GL transaction in the     document ( _CAD_ ) and base ( _USD_ ) currencies.     When the invoice was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The Accounts Receivable account of the customer ( _11000_ ) was debited in the total invoice amount     (C$450.02, which is $330.76 based on the document exchange rate). 

- The sales account of the customer ( _40000_ ) was credited in the invoice amounts specified in the     document lines ($220.51 = C$300.01 * 0.735 for the first line, and $110.26 = C$150.01 * 0.735 for the     second line). 

- The rounding gain/loss account ( _83100_ ) was debited in the amount of the rounding loss ($0.01 = $330.77 

- $330.76), which is due to rounding operations. (You specified this account for _CAD_ on the _Currencies_ (CM202000) form while performing _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ .) The rounding loss is caused by the difference between the document balance converted into the base currency ($330.77 = Round (C$450.02 * 0.735)) and the total of the line amounts converted into the base currency ($330.76 = Round (C$300.01 * 0.735) + Round (C$150.01 * 0.735)). 

#### Step 5: Reviewing the Customer's Balance 

 To review the customer's balance, do the following: 

1. Open the _AR Balance by Customer MC_ (AR633000) report form. 

2. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following parameters: 

- **Report Format** : _Open Documents_     This option means that the report will list all the documents that are open at the end of the selected     period. 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE (SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center)_ 

- **Financial Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Customer** : _MINTSTORE_ 

- **Include Applications** : Cleared 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report**. 

4. Review the report, which displays the invoice that you have processed and have not yet paid.     As the report shows, at the end of the period, the customer's outstanding balance is C$450.02, which is     $330.76 in the base currency. 

#### Step 6: Applying a Payment in the Same Foreign Currency to the Invoice 

 To create a payment and apply it to the invoice, do the following: 

1. Open the _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Payment_ 

- **Customer** : _MINTSTORE_ 

- **Payment Method** : _WIRE_ (inserted automatically when you select the customer) 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Invoices in Foreign Currencies | 22 

- **Cash Account** : _10215WH_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ (inserted automatically when you select the cash account)     A payment is always created in the currency of the selected cash account; this currency can differ from     the customer's currency and cannot be overridden. 

- **Description** : Juicer installation 

- **Application Date** : _1/30/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _01-2026_ On the **Documents to Apply** tab, the system has loaded the invoice that you created for this customer earlier. 

3. Select the Included check box for the row with the invoice, and in the Summary area, click the Refresh     button to the right of the **Payment Amount** box. 

4. In the Summary area, click the **View Base** button (right of the **Currency** box), and review the payment     amount in the base currency.     The payment amount is recalculated in the base currency by the exchange rate of the payment and is     $352.24 (C$450.02 * 0.7827176, which is the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ exchange rate that was effective on the payment     date of 1/30/2026). 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

6. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

7. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated GL transaction in the     document currency. 

8. In the Summary area, click **View Base** (right of the **Currency** box), and review the transaction in the base     currency.     When the payment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10215_ ), which you created in _Multicurrency Functionality:_     _Implementation Activity_ , was debited in the payment amount, which the system converted to the base     currency by using the exchange rate of the payment ($352.24 = Round (C$450.02 * 0.7827176)). 

- The Accounts Receivable account of the customer ( _11000_ ) was credited in the payment amount applied     to the invoice; the system converted the payment amount to the base currency by using the exchange     rate of the invoice ($330.76 = Round (C$450.02 * 0.735). 

- The realized gain account associated with the _CAD_ currency ( _42010_ , which you specified when you     defined the currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ), was credited in the amount     of the realized gain, which is the result of differences in the rates of the invoice and the payment. The     payment rate is greater than the invoice rate. Thus, the result of applying the payment to the invoice is a     realized gain in the amount of $21.48 ($352.24 – $330.76). 

### AR Invoices in Foreign Currencies: Related Reports and Forms

#### Reviewing Customer Balances in a Foreign Currency 

 You can review a customer's balance broken down by document and the current balance in both the base currency and in a foreign currency on the Customer Details (AR402000) form. The inquiry form shows document amounts in the foreign currency, the same amounts recalculated to the base currency, and the realized gains and losses. 

#### Reviewing AR Balance by Customer in a Foreign Currency 

 You can review the outstanding foreign currency balance of a particular customer or all customers for a selected financial period by running the AR Balance by Customer MC (AR633000) report. 

#### Reviewing Invoices Coming Due 

 To determine when you should expect to receive payments for the outstanding multicurrency documents, you can use the AR Coming Due MC (AR631600) report. The report shows all open documents recorded in the system, regardless of the current business date or the date specified in the Date box on this report form. 

#### Reviewing Invoices Overdue for Payment 

 To determine which multicurrency documents are overdue for payment and for how long, you can run the AR Aging MC (AR631100) report. The report shows all released AR documents in the system, and the document balances on the date specified in the Age as of Date box on this report form.

 Applying Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies to Invoices | 24 

## Applying Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies to Invoices 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to apply a credit memo in a foreign currency to an AR invoice in the same foreign currency. 

### Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, the amount of a released invoice, which increases a customer’s debt, cannot be changed directly in the released document. If you need to decrease the customer's balance, you issue a credit memo. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create a credit memo in a foreign currency 

- Apply the credit memo to an invoice in a foreign currency 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create a credit memo in a foreign currency in the following cases: 

- You need to adjust the balance of a released multicurrency invoice. 

- You need to decrease the amount owed to you by a particular customer. 

#### Use of a Credit Memo to Decrease the Amount of an Invoice 

 You issue a credit memo, which will be used to decrease a customer’s debt, by using the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form—the same form you use to create an invoice. The credit memo is independent of the original invoice, with no direct reference to it. The processing of a credit memo includes the application of this credit memo to the applicable invoice, which establishes a link between these two documents. A credit memo may have multiple lines or one summary line. Credit memos do not have due dates and may be numbered differently from invoices, depending on the standards in place in your organization. 

 The release of a credit memo decreases the customer's balance. The application of a released credit memo against invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges decreases the outstanding amount of these documents by the amount of the credit memo. For details, see Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity. 

### Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for applying a credit memo in a foreign currency to an invoice, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially create a credit memo, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Applying Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies to Invoices | 25 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Customers (AR303000) Make sure that the customer accounts for the customers for which you will create AR documents have been defined. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AR document has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing credit memos by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AR transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear     the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system consolidates     into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents     being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Receivable Preferences_ (AR101000) form: 

- To cause all created credit memos to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry**     check box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created credit memos are     assigned the _On Hold_ status. 

- To make entering a payment reference number in the **Payment Ref.** box mandatory when creating a     payment on the _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form, select the **Require Payment Reference**     **on Entry** check box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is cleared, you can leave the     **Payment Ref.** box empty when creating a payment. 

- To cause credit memos to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select     the **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is     cleared, you have to post the batch aer you release the document.

#### Transaction Generated for a Credit Memo 

 When you create and release a credit memo, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account 0.00 Amount 

 Sales account Amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

#### Transactions Generated for a Credit Memo Application Producing RGOL 

 When you release a credit memo application to an invoice in a foreign currency, the difference in currency rates can produce a realized gain or loss (RGOL). 

 The following GL transaction is generated if the application produced a realized gain. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account Gain amount 0.00 

 Realized Gain/Loss account 0.00 Gain amount 

 The following GL transaction is generated if the application produced a realized loss. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account 0.00 Loss amount 

 Realized Gain/Loss account Loss amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. 

### Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of creating a credit memo in a foreign currency and applying it to an invoice in the same currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on February 1, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams provided consulting services to the EasyDiner customer in the amount of 80 euros (€80). On February 15, 2026, SweetLife gave a discount on these services and issued a €5 credit memo to the customer.

<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Applying Credit Memos in Foreign Currencies to Invoices | 29 

- **Transaction Descr.** : Discount on consulting services 

- **Ext. Price** : 5.00 The currency rate specified for the credit memo is 1.1411617, which is the effective rate on the document date. The invoice on which the discount is given was created with a currency rate of 1.11520018. If you apply this credit memo to the invoice, the operation will produce a realized loss, which is due to the difference of the currency rates. 

 If you want to apply the credit memo to the invoice without a realized gain or loss, you need to change the currency rate of the credit memo to the rate specified in the invoice. 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the credit memo. 

4. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

5. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated batch in the base currency     ( _USD_ ).     When the credit memo was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The Accounts Receivable account of the customer ( _11000_ ) was credited in the amount of the credit     memo; the system converted the amount to the base currency by using the document rate ($5.71 =     Round (€5.00 * 1.1411617)) to decrease the customer's debt. 

- The Sales account of the customer ( _40000_ ) was debited in the amount of the credit memo ($5.71 = Round     (€5.00 * 1.1411617)) to increase the realized loss produced by the invoice. 

#### Step 4: Applying the Credit Memo to the Invoice 

 To apply the credit memo to the invoice, do the following: 

1. On the form toolbar of the _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form with the credit memo opened, click **Apply**. 

2. On the _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form, which opens, make sure that the following settings are     specified: 

- **Application Date** : _2/15/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _02-2026_ 

3. On the table toolbar of the **Documents to Apply** tab, click **Load Documents**. Leave the default settings in     the **Load Options** dialog box, which opens, and click **Load**.     When you click **Load** , the dialog box closes. On the **Documents to Apply** tab, the invoice dated 2/1/2026, to     which the memo will be applied, is displayed. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Release** to release the application. 

5. Review the **Application History** tab. When the system applied the credit memo to the invoice, it generated a     GL transaction, whose reference number is shown in the **Batch Number** column. 

 If the application did not produce realized gain or loss, no transaction would be generated on release of the application; thus, the Batch Number column would be empty for the application on the Application History tab. 

6. Click the link in the **Batch Number** column, and on the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens,     review the generated GL transaction in the base currency.     When the application was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The AR account specified in the invoice ( _11000_ ) was debited in the amount of the realized gain, which has     been calculated as follows: $0.13 = Round (€5.00 * 1.11520018) – Round (€5.00 * 1.1411617)). 

- The realized gain/loss account of the document currency ( _83000_ ) was credited in the amount of $0.13 to     record the realized gain.

## Paying Multicurrency Invoices 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to pay an invoice in a foreign currency by using the base currency and how to pay an invoice in a foreign currency by using another foreign currency. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can apply payments created in one currency to documents created in another currency, and payments created in the base currency to documents created in a foreign currency. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create an invoice in a foreign currency and a payment for it in the base currency 

- Create an invoice in a foreign currency and a payment for it in another foreign currency 

- Review and analyze how the system applies payments to invoices when the currency of the payment differs     from the currency of the invoice 

- Override the cross rate used in the payment 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You process an invoice in a foreign currency by using the base currency in the following cases: 

- Your company has received a payment in a foreign currency to its bank account in the base currency and     needs to convert the payment to fully close the invoice. 

- Your company has received a payment in a foreign currency, but does not have a bank account in this     currency. 

#### Application of a Cross Rate 

 When the system applies the payment, if the currency of the document differs from the currency of the payment, the system uses a cross rate to calculate the amount of the invoice that is being paid. The cross rate determines how to convert the amount paid in the payment currency to the invoice currency. 

 By default, the cross rate is calculated as the effective rate of the invoice currency on the payment date divided by the payment rate. The default cross rate can be overridden in the payments that are applied to the invoices in the foreign currency. 

 You cannot override the cross rate of payment application to the documents in the base currency because realized gain or loss (RGOL) is not calculated for these documents. 

#### Calculation and Application of RGOL 

 When a payment is applied to an AR invoice, and the payment and the invoice are in different currencies, the system calculates realized gain or loss (RGOL) in the base currency by using the following formula: 

 RGOL Amount = Round (Payment Amount * Payment Rate) – Round (Payment Amount Converted * Invoice Rate) 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Invoices | 32 

 In this formula, Payment Amount Converted = Round (Payment Amount/Cross Rate) 

 That is, the realized gain or loss is calculated as the payment amount in the base currency minus the part of the invoice that is being paid (converted to the base currency). To compute the invoice amount that is being paid, the system has to convert the payment amount into the base currency by using the payment rate and then into the invoice currency by using the reciprocal rate of the invoice currency that was effective on the payment date. That is, to convert the payment amount into the invoice currency, the system divides the payment amount by the cross rate. When the payment is applied, the balance of the invoice is reduced by the payment amount converted into the invoice currency by using the cross rate. 

 The RGOL amount calculated when the system applies a payment to an invoice is processed as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive, meaning that the application of this payment produces a gain,     the realized gain account associated with the invoice currency is credited in the RGOL amount. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative, indicating that the application of this payment produces a loss,     the realized loss account associated with the invoice currency is debited in the amount of (–1) * RGOL. If a payment is issued in a foreign currency other than the foreign currency of the document, the realized gain or loss is calculated as the amount of the payment in the base currency (calculated using the exchange rate specified for the payment) minus the original amount of the document in the base currency. The following formula is used. 

 RGOL Amount = Round (Payment Amount * Payment Rate) – Round (Payment Amount Converted * Document Rate), where 

 Payment Amount Converted = Round(Payment Amount/Cross Rate), where 

 Cross Rate = Document Rate/Payment Rate (on the payment date) 

 In these formulas, Round () indicates that the amount within parentheses is rounded to the decimal precision that is set for the base currency in the Summary area of the Currencies (CM202000) form. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: Entry of the Payment Amount Instead of the 

### Cross Rate 

 When you create a payment on the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, you can enter the amount paid, cash discount taken, and write-off amount in the document currency. You don't need to manually calculate the cross rate based on application amounts. 

 On this form, you can also: 

- **Review the exact cross rate** used for payments received from customers 

- **Enter either a direct rate or a reciprocal rate** when applying payments to invoices in different currencies For more details, see _Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Change the Payment Amount Instead of the Cross Rate_. 

#### Cross Rate Selection 

 On the Documents to Apply tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, the value in the Cross Rate column is a link. If you click this link, the Cross Rate Selection dialog box opens. 

 This dialog box contains the Currency Unit Equivalents section, which includes the default direct and reciprocal rates. You can update the reciprocal rate, and the system will recalculate the direct rate. Similarly, if you change the direct rate, the system will recalculate the reciprocal rate.

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing AR invoices in a foreign currency by using the base currency and another foreign currency, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially process AR invoices in a foreign currency, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Customers (AR303000) Make sure that the customer accounts for the customers for which you will create AR documents have been defined. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AR document has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing AR invoices by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AR transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear     the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system consolidates     into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents     being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Receivable Preferences_ (AR101000) form: 

- To cause all created AR invoices to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check     box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AR invoices are assigned     the _On Hold_ status. 

- To make entering a payment reference number in the **Payment Ref.** box mandatory when creating a     payment on the _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form, select the **Require Payment Reference**     **on Entry** check box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is cleared, you can leave the     **Payment Ref.** box empty when creating a payment. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->

- To cause AR invoices to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process AR invoices in a foreign currency by performing instructions similar to those described in Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Pay a Foreign Currency Invoice by Using the Base Currency and Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Pay a Foreign Currency Invoice by Using Another Currency. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: Generated Transactions 

 To be able to pay an AR invoice in a foreign currency by using the base currency or another foreign currency, you create and process an invoice and a payment. To update customer balances, the system generates the GL transactions described in the following sections. 

#### Transaction Generated for an AR Invoice 

 When you create and release a one-line AR invoice, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account Amount 0.00 

 Sales Revenue account 0.00 Amount 

 Rounding Gain/Loss account Rounding loss amount Rounding gain amount 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

#### Transactions Generated for an Invoice Payment 

 When you create and release a payment in the base currency, which was converted at a currency rate greater than that of the invoice, the system produces a positive RGOL amount and generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account Payment amount 0.00 

 Accounts Receivable account 0.00 Invoice amount 

 Realized Gain account 0.00 Realized gain amount 

 When you create and release a payment in the base currency, which was converted at a currency rate less than that of the invoice, the system produces a negative RGOL amount and generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account Payment amount 0.00 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Invoices | 35

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Pay a Foreign Currency Invoice by Using the 

### Base Currency 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of creating an AR invoice in a foreign currency and paying it by using the base currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 30, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams provided services to the Mint Store customer in the amount of 200 Canadian dollars (C$200). According to SweetLife's bank records, on February 20, 2026, the company received C$200 from Mint Store. This amount was converted from CAD into USD by the bank by using the actual bank exchange rate (0.7913) on the date when the bank received the payment to $158.26. 

 Because SweetLife received this amount to its USD bank account, the C$200 sent by the customer to SweetLife must be converted to the correct amount in USD so that the C$200 invoice can be closed. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to process the invoice and apply the payment to it. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _10200 (Company Checking Account)_ , _11000 (Accounts_     _Receivable)_ , _40000 (Sales Revenue)_ , and _42010 (Realized Gain CAD)_ accounts have been created. 

- On the _Customers_ (AR303000) form, the _MINTSTORE_ customer has been predefined. 

- On the _Payment Methods_ (CA204000) form, the cash account for the _CAD_ currency has been added for the     _WIRE_ payment method. 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you will create and post an AR invoice in the CAD currency. On the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, you will create a payment in the base currency and apply it to the invoice in CAD. To fully pay the invoice, you will update the cross rate for the invoice, and then

- **Cash Account** : _10200WH (Wholesale Checking)_ 

- **Currency** : _USD_ (inserted automatically when you select the cash account) 

- **Description** : Services (January) 

- **Application Date** : _2/20/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _02-2026_ 

- **Payment Amount** : 158.26 On the **Documents to Apply** tab, the system has loaded the invoice you created for this customer earlier. 

3. Select the Included check box for the row with the invoice to select it, and review the amounts in the     Summary area.     The payment is in the base currency because the specified cash account is maintained in the base currency.     Its amount is $158.26, according to the bank records. The cross rate shown in the **Cross Rate** column in the     table, which is calculated between the currency of the original document ( _CAD_ ) and the currency of the     payment ( _USD_ ), is 0.78758762, which is the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ exchange rate that was effective on 2/20/2026.     As you can see, when you apply the payment to the invoice, the invoice will be fully paid and its **Balance**     will be $0.00, while the payment will still have an open balance in the amount of $0.74. The SweetLife     accountant knows that the invoice should be fully paid, because Mint Store sent exactly C$200.00, which is     the outstanding balance of the invoice.     To close both the invoice and the payment, you have to set the cross rate equal to the bank exchange rate     (0.7913), so that the amount paid for the invoice and the amount applied to the invoice will be equal. Aer     you apply the payment to the invoice, both the **Balance** of the invoice and the **Available Balance** of the     payment will be _0.00_ in both currencies. 

4. In the table, enter 0.7913 in the **Cross Rate** column to use this rate in the payment.     Now the amount in the base currency that will be applied to the invoice ( **Amount Paid (USD)** ) is equal to the     **Payment Amount** of the payment. 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

6. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link, and review the generated transaction on the _Journal_     _Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens.     When the payment and its application were released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10200_ ) was debited in the amount of the payment     applied to the invoice ($158.26) 

- The AR account of the customer ( _11000_ ) was credited in the total amount of the invoice, which equals the     payment amount divided by the cross rate and multiplied by the invoice rate ($156.54 = Round ($158.26 /     0.7913 * 0.7827176)), to decrease the customer's outstanding balance and close the invoice.

- The realized gain account associated with the document currency ( _42010_ ), which you specified when you     defined the currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ , was credited in the amount of     the realized gain, which is the amount of the payment in the base currency minus the original amount of     the invoice in the base currency ($1.72 = $158.26 – $156.54). 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Pay a Foreign Currency Invoice by Using 

### Another Currency 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of paying an invoice in a foreign currency by using another foreign currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 10, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams provided consulting services to the EasyDiner customer in the amount of 50 euros ( EUR in the system). By the end of January, the customer informed SweetLife that they were going to pay the invoice in Canadian dollars ( CAD ). SweetLife agreed to use for the payment the following exchange rate: 1 EUR = 1.51 CAD. On January 31, EasyDiner made the first partial payment in the amount of 20 Canadian dollars. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to process the invoice and apply the payment to it. Then you need to print the multicurrency report to review the outstanding balance of the customer. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _11000 (Accounts Receivable)_ and _83000 (Realized Gain/Loss_     _Currency)_ accounts have been created. 

- On the _Customers_ (AR303000) form, the _EASYDINER_ customer has been predefined. 

- On the _Payment Methods_ (CA204000) form, the _WIRE_ payment method for wire transfers has been created. 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you will create and release an invoice in EUR. On the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, you will partially pay this invoice in the amount of 20 CAD. Finally, you will print the multicurrency report on the AR Balance by Customer MC (AR633000) form to review the outstanding balance of the customer.

6. Make sure that the settings of the _EASYDINER_ customer have been updated as described in _Credit Memos in_     _Foreign Currencies: Process Activity_. 

#### Step 1: Creating and Releasing an Invoice 

 To create an invoice in a foreign currency and release it, do the following: 

1. Open the _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Invoice_ 

- **Customer** : _EASYDINER_ 

- **Currency** : _EUR_ (automatically inserted; cannot be overridden)

- **Description** : Partial payment on consulting services 

- **Application Date** : _1/31/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Payment Amount** : 20.00 On the **Documents to Apply** tab, the system has loaded the invoices you created for this customer in Step 1 of this activity and in a previous activity. 

3. Select the Included check box for the invoice dated 1/10/2026 to select it.     The default cross rate for the payment application is calculated as the exchange rate of the invoice     currency that was effective on the payment date divided by the currency rate of the payment: 1.424779... =     1.11520018 / 0.7827176.     You have to override this rate to 1.51, which is the _EUR_ -to- _CAD_ rate that had been agreed on with the     customer. Thus, the payment amount converted to _EUR_ is €13.24 (C$20 / 1.51). This amount is not shown on     the form. 

4. In the **Cross Rate** column, enter 1.51, and review the payment in the invoice currency and in the base     currency. 

5. In the **Amount Paid (CAD)** column for the invoice, specify 20.00.     Based on the actual exchange rate on the date of the payment, the payment amount in _USD_ is $15.65     (C$20.00 * 0.7827176).     The balance that you see in the **Balance** column of the table for the invoice is the open amount of the     invoice aer you apply the payment, which is shown in the payment currency and is converted by using the     cross rate: (€50.00 – €13.24) * 1.51 = C$55.50. 

6. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

7. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

8. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the GL transaction in the base currency     ( _USD_ ).     When the payment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10215_ , which you created in _Multicurrency Functionality:_     _Implementation Activity_ ) was debited in the amount of the payment that the system converted to the base     currency by using the payment rate ($15.65 = Round (€20 * 0.7827176)). 

- The Accounts Receivable account of the customer ( _11000_ ) was credited in the amount in the base     currency deducted from the invoice balance ($15.06 = Round (Round (€20 * 1.13739505) / 1.51)) to     decrease the customer's debt. 

- The realized gain/loss account of the document currency ( _83000_ , which you specified when you defined     the currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in the amount of the     realized gain, which is the amount of the payment in the base currency minus the amount in the base     currency deducted from the invoice balance ($0.59 = $15.65 – $15.06). 

 If an invoice is issued in the base currency, no gain or loss will be realized on the payment, regardless of the currency of the payment. 

9. On the _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form, open the invoice to which you have applied the payment, and     review the **Applications** tab.     The payment in _CAD_ was applied to the invoice. The balance of the invoice is currently €36.76. 

#### Step 3: Printing the Multicurrency Report 

 To review the outstanding balance of all customers and print the multicurrency report, do the following: 

1. Open the _AR Balance by Customer MC_ (AR633000) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Invoices | 41 

2. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following settings: 

- **Report Format** : _Open + Current Period_ 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE_ 

- **Financial Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Include Applications** : Cleared 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report** and review the report.     The report lists all the documents processed in the 01-2026 period, along with the documents that are     open at the end of the period. The listed documents are grouped by customer. For each document, you can     review the document balance in the document currency. Also, for each customer, you can review the total of     the documents in each currency at the end of the period. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Invoices: To Change the Payment Amount Instead of the 

### Cross Rate 

 This activity will walk you through the process of configuring a foreign currency and using it to pay an invoice in another foreign currency. You will also change the reciprocal rate and the amount paid in the created payment. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that SweetLife Fruits & Jams provides professional training services to its customer, Unifruit LLC, which operates in a multicurrency environment. SweetLife’s base currency is USD, but it conducts business using foreign currencies—specifically, EUR and GBP—to meet customer and banking requirements. 

 On March 1, 2026, SweetLife issued an AR invoice for EUR 1000 to Unifruit for training services, using an agreed-on exchange rate (1 USD = 1.1 EUR). 

 On March 10, 2026, Unifruit settled the invoice by making a payment in GBP via wire transfer. SweetLife applied the payment from its GBP cash account and used a defined cross rate to convert the GBP payment into EUR. The system initially calculated a default GBP amount (GBP 504.35) based on existing rates, which wouldn’t fully settle the EUR invoice. The final payment amount (GBP 869.57) fully settled the EUR invoice. (To reflect the actual exchange rate agreed on at payment time, SweetLife manually updated the reciprocal rate so that 1 GBP = 1.43111816 EUR. This tells the system how GBP should be converted into EUR for this specific payment.) 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to set up the system for processing payments in GBP, create an invoice in EUR, and pay it in GBP.

 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 46 

## Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to process and pay an AP bill in a foreign currency. 

### AP Bills in Foreign Currencies: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, the multicurrency functionality is supported for AP documents. The system recalculates all transactions made in a foreign currency to the company's base currency. To record the difference resulting from rounding during currency conversion, the system uses the rounding gain and loss accounts specified for the document currency on the Currencies (CM202000) form. The small amount resulting from the currency rounding may be posted as a debit or a credit, depending on its sign. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create and process a bill in a foreign currency 

- Pay a bill in the same foreign currency 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You process bills in a foreign currency if your vendors send you bills in this currency and expect you to pay them in the same currency. 

#### Processing of a Bill in a Foreign Currency 

 When an AP document is created, the system uses the currency settings of the vendor that is selected in the document. These currency settings are the currency, currency rate type, currency override ability, and currency rate override ability. 

 The GL transaction posted to the general ledger on release of the AP document, and the document itself can be reviewed in two currencies: the base currency and the document currency. To recalculate the document amounts in the base currency, the system uses the currency exchange rate that was effective on the date of the document, unless the rate is overridden in the document. 

 The RGOL amount calculated when a payment or debit adjustment is applied to a bill is processed as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative, meaning that the application produces a gain, the realized gain     account associated with the bill currency is credited in the amount of (–1) * RGOL. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive, which indicates that the application produces a loss, the realized     loss account associated with the bill currency is debited in the amount of the calculated RGOL. 

#### Formula to Calculate Realized Gains and Losses 

 When a payment is applied to an AP bill, and the payment and the bill are in the same foreign currency, the system calculates the realized gain or loss (RGOL) in the base currency by using the following formula: 

 RGOL Amount = Round (Payment Amount * Payment Rate) – Round (Payment Amount * Bill Rate) 

 That is, the system calculates the realized gain or loss as the payment amount converted into the base currency by using the payment rate minus the payment amount, which the system has converted into the base currency by 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 47 

 using the bill rate. Round () indicates that the amount within parentheses is rounded to the decimal precision that is set for the base currency. 

#### Application of RGOL Amounts to Bills 

 A realized gain or loss (RGOL) is calculated when a payment in a foreign currency is applied to an AP bill. The system compares the exchange rate of the bill to the exchange rate of the payment and calculates the realized gain or loss. When the payment is applied to the bill, the RGOL amount is processed by the system as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative, meaning that the application of the payment produces a gain,     the realized gain account associated with the bill currency is credited in the amount of (–1) * RGOL. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive, meaning that the application of the payment produces a loss, the     realized loss account associated with the bill currency is debited in the amount of the calculated RGOL. 

### AP Bills in Foreign Currencies: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing AP bills in a foreign currency, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially process AP bills in a foreign currency, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Steps to Perform 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Vendors (AP303000) Make sure that the vendor accounts for the vendors for which you will create AP documents have been defined. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AP document has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing AP bills by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AP transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear     the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system consolidates 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 48 

 into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Payable Preferences_ (AP101000) form: 

- To cause all created AP bills to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check box     in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AP bills are assigned the _On_     _Hold_ status. 

- To make entering a vendor reference number in the **Vendor Ref.** box mandatory when creating an AP     bill on the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form, select the **Require Vendor Reference** check box in the     **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is cleared, you can leave the **Vendor Ref.** box empty when     creating an AP bill. 

- To cause AP bills to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process AP bills in a foreign currency by performing instructions similar to those described in AP Bills in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity. 

### AP Bills in Foreign Currencies: Generated Transactions 

 To be able to process AP bills in a foreign currency, you create and process a bill and a payment. To update vendor balances, the system generates the GL transactions described in the following sections. 

#### Transaction Generated for an AP Bill 

 When you create and release a one-line bill, the following transaction will be recorded to the general ledger when the bill is released. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable account 0.00 Amount 

 Expense account Amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. 

#### Transactions Generated for a Bill Payment 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency and the currency rate of the payment is greater than that of the bill, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account 0.00 Amount 

 Accounts Payable account Amount + realized gain amount 0.00 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 49 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Realized Gain account 0.00 Realized gain amount 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency and the currency rate of the payment is less than that of the bill, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account 0.00 Amount + realized loss amount 

 Accounts Payable account Amount 0.00 

 Realized Loss account Realized loss amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form. 

### AP Bills in Foreign Currencies: Process Activity 

 The following activity will walk you through the processing of an AP bill in a foreign currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 13, 2026, MapleLeaf Ads Co. provided services to the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company in the amount of 350 Canadian dollars (defined as CAD in the system), for which MapleLeaf billed SweetLife. On January 30, 2026, SweetLife paid this bill. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to create a bill and apply a payment in CAD (that is, in the same foreign currency) to the bill. Before you perform these actions, you will make changes to the MapleLeaf vendor’s settings so that bill processing can be performed in line with its currency-related preferences. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _20000 (Accounts Payable)_ , _81000 (Other Expenses)_ , and _42010_     _(Realized Gain CAD)_ accounts have been created. 

- On the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form, the _MAPLELEAF_ vendor has been predefined. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 50 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, you will first update the currency-related settings of the MapleLeaf Co. vendor on the Vendors (AP303000) form. On the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you will then create and release an AP bill in the CAD currency. You will then pay this bill on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form. 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, do the following: 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the _U100_ dataset preloaded, and sign in as an accountant Anna     Johnson by using the _johnson_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the     business date in your system is set to _1/13/2026_. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu     button, and select _1/13/2026_ from the calendar. 

3. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that     the _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

4. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 

5. Make sure that you have configured an account as described in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an_     _Account_. 

#### Step 1: Updating the Vendor's Settings 

 To update the currency-related settings of the vendor (which has been preconfigured in the U100 dataset) in preparation for multicurrency bill processing, do the following: 

1. Open the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form. 

2. In the **Vendor ID** box, select _MAPLELEAF_. 

3. On the **Financial** tab ( **Financial Settings** section), do the following: 

- In the **Currency ID** box, select _CAD_.     This is the primary currency to be inserted in bills and adjustments to this vendor. 

- Notice that the **Curr. Rate Type** box is empty, which is the default value of this setting copied from the     settings of the vendor class.     This setting specifies the currency rate type to be used for the vendor. Because you are not specifying     a **Curr. Rate Type** for the vendor, the system will use the _SPOT_ rate, which is set as the default rate for     accounts payable on the _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form. 

- Notice that the **Enable Currency Override** check box is cleared, which is the default state of the setting     copied from the vendor class.     With this check box cleared, you cannot override the currency in the bills and adjustments to this vendor.     That is, the setting in the **Currency ID** box on this form for the vendor is the only currency that may be     used in documents for this vendor. 

- Make sure that the **Enable Rate Override** check box is cleared.     With this check box cleared, you cannot override the rate type and exchange rate in documents created     for this vendor. 

4. On the **Payment** tab ( **Default Payment Settings** section), specify the following settings: 

- **Payment Method** : _WIRE_ 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 51 

- **Cash Account** : _10215WH (Checking Account CAD)_ 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Save** to save your changes. 

#### Step 2: Creating and Releasing a Bill 

 To create and release a bill in the CAD currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Bill_ 

- **Vendor** : _MAPLELEAF_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ (inserted automatically when you selected the vendor)     The _CAD_ currency is selected in the bill because you have assigned this currency to the vendor. Thus,     the document amounts are specified in Canadian dollars. You cannot override the currency in this     particular bill because the **Enable Currency Override** check box is cleared for the vendor on the _Vendors_     (AP303000) form. 

- **Date** : _1/13/2026_ 

- **Post Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Description** : Services 

3. On the **Details** tab, click **Add Row** , and in the added row, specify the following settings: 

- **Transaction Descr.** : Services 

- **Ext. Cost** : 350.00 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Save**. 

5. In the Summary area, click the **Exchange Rate** box (right of the **Currency** box), and review the **Rate**     **Selection** dialog box, which opens.     The **Curr. Rate Type ID** ( _SPOT_ ) is the default rate type determined by the **AP Rate Type** setting on the     _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form, because you haven't specified a rate type in the vendor     record. The currency rate of the _SPOT_ rate type for 1/13/2026 is the currency rate that is effective starting on     1/1/2026. You cannot override the rate type and rate in this document because the **Enable Rate Override**     check box is cleared for the vendor on the _Vendors_ form. 

 Any time you need to check which currency rate was effective on a particular date, on the Currency Rates (CM301000) form, you can select the needed date in the Effective Date box and review the Effective Currency Rates tab. 

6. Click **OK** to close the **Rate Selection** dialog box. 

7. In the Summary area, click the **View Base** button (right of the **Currency** box) to review the bill amounts in     the base currency ( _USD_ ).     For converting the bill amounts, the system uses the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ rate that was effective on the bill date.     Thus, the detail total is C$350.00 * 0.78907914 = $276.18 

 You can edit amounts in the document only while viewing the document in the document currency. When you are reviewing the document in the base currency, you cannot modify the document amounts. 

8. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the bill. 

9. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 10.On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, review the generated GL transaction in the foreign currency of     the document ( _CAD_ ) and in the base currency ( _USD_ ). 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Bills in Foreign Currencies | 52 

 When the system released the transaction: 

- The AP account specified in the bill ( _20000_ ) was credited in the amount of the bill, which the system     converted to the base currency by using the rate specified in the bill (Round (C$350.00 * 0.78907914) =     $276.18). 

- The expense account specified in the document line ( _81000_ ) was debited in the line amount (Round     (C$350.00 * 0.78907914) = $276.18). 

#### Step 3: Applying a Payment in the Same Foreign Currency to the Bill 

 To apply a payment in the same foreign currency to the bill, do the following: 

1. While you are still on the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form with the bill opened, on the form toolbar,     click **Pay**. The _Checks and Payments_ (AP302000) form opens. 

2. In the Summary area of this form, specify the following settings: 

- **Application Date** : _1/30/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _01-2026_ The payment is created in _CAD_ , because the cash account denominated in _CAD_ is specified as the default payment account for the vendor. 

3. Click **View Base** (right of the **Currency** box), and review the payment in the base currency.     The payment amount in _USD_ is $273.95 (C$350 * 0.78271760, which is the _CAD_ -to- _USD_ exchange rate that     was effective on the payment date _1/30/2026_ ). 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

5. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

6. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated GL transaction in the     document currency ( _CAD_ ) and in the base currency ( _USD_ ).     When the payment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10215_ ) was credited in the payment amount, which the     system converted to the base currency by using the payment rate as follows: $273.95 = Round (C$350 *     0.78271760). 

- The Accounts Payable account specified in the bill ( _20000_ ) was debited in the payment amount applied to     the bill; the system converted the payment amount to the base currency by using the rate specified in the     bill ($276.18 = Round (C$350 * 0.78907914)). 

- The realized gain account of the document currency ( _42010_ ), which you specified when you defined the     currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ , was credited in the amount of the realized     gain, which is the result of the difference between the rates specified in the bill and in the payment. The     payment rate is less than the bill rate, so the result of applying the payment is a gain in the amount of     $2.23 ($276.18 – $273.95).

## Applying Debit Adjustments in Foreign Currencies to Bills 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to apply a debit adjustment to a bill in a foreign currency. 

### Debit Adjustments in Foreign Currencies: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, once an AP document has been released, it cannot be edited or deleted; to correct it, you can issue an adjustment. Debit adjustments decrease the accounts payable balance of a vendor. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create a debit adjustment in a foreign currency 

- Apply a payment and the debit adjustment to a bill in a foreign currency 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create a debit adjustment in a foreign currency in the following cases: 

- You need to adjust the balance of a released multicurrency bill. 

- You need to decrease the amount your company owes to a vendor. 

#### Processing of a Debit Adjustment 

 You can enter a debit adjustment by using the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. The summary of a debit adjustment includes information about the vendor, the vendor location, and the currency used for the transaction. 

 Generally, a debit adjustment is not linked to a bill or another document to which the debit adjustment is related. In the Summary area of the form, you may include the reference number of the original document (bill or prepayment) in the description of the adjustment and the reference number of the related vendor document in the Vendor Reference box. 

 Released debit adjustments appear on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form and can be applied against credit adjustments and bills. 

#### Application of RGOL Amounts to Bills 

 A realized gain or loss (RGOL) is calculated when a debit adjustment in a foreign currency is applied to an AP document. The system compares the exchange rate of the document to the exchange rate on the date of settlement and calculates the realized gain or loss. When a debit adjustment is applied to a document, the RGOL amount is processed by the system as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative, meaning that the application of the payment produces a gain,     the realized gain account associated with the bill currency is credited in the amount of (–1) * RGOL. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive, meaning that the application of the payment produces a loss, the     realized loss account associated with the bill currency is debited in the amount of the calculated RGOL.

5. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

6. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated transaction in the base     currency ( _USD_ ).     When the debit adjustment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The AP account of the vendor ( _20000_ ) was debited in the debit adjustment amount, which the system     converted to the base currency by using the document rate ($3.91 = Round (C$5.00 * 0.7827176)) to     decrease the vendor balance. 

- The Expenses account of the vendor ( _81000_ ) was credited in the debit adjustment amount ($3.91 = Round     (C$5.00 * 0.7827176)). 

#### Step 3: Creating a Payment; Applying the Payment and the Debit Adjustment to the Bill 

 To create a payment and to apply it and the debit adjustment to the bill, do the following: 

1. Open the _Checks and Payments_ (AP302000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Payment_ 

- **Vendor** : _MAPLELEAF_ 

- **Payment Method** : _WIRE_ (inserted automatically when you select the vendor) 

- **Cash Account** : _10215WH (Checking Account CAD)_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ (inserted automatically when you select the cash account) 

- **Application Date** : _2/10/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _02-2026_ 

- **Description** : Partial payment on additional services 

- **Payment Amount** : 45.00     The payment is created with a currency rate of 0.78758762, which is the effective rate on the payment     date. 

3. On the toolbar of the **Documents to Apply** tab, click **Load Documents**.     The bill and debit adjustment that you have prepared earlier appear in the table. For the debit adjustment     in the table, when you specify the **Amount Paid (Payment currency)** , the payment balance available for     application increases by this amount. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment and the     applications. 

5. Review the **Application History** tab.     On release of the payment and the applications, the system generated a GL batch that includes the     transactions produced by the payment and its applications. The reference number (which is a link) to the     generated transaction is shown in the **Batch Number** column. 

6. Click the link in the **Batch Number** column. 

7. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated transaction in the base     currency ( _USD_ ).     When the payment and applications were released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10215_ , which you created in _Multicurrency Functionality:_     _Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in the amount of the payment ($35.44 = Round (C$45.00 *     0.78758762)). 

- The AP account specified in both the bill and the debit adjustment ( _20000_ ) was debited in the amount     deducted from SweetLife's liability to the vendor. This amount is the difference between the debit     adjustment amount and the amount to which the bill balance is decreased: ($35.30 = Round (–C$5.00 *     0.7827176) + Round (C$50.00 * 0.78419072)). 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Applying Debit Adjustments in Foreign Currencies to Bills | 60 

- The realized gain account was credited to the realized gain account of the currency ( _42010_ ) associated     with the bill. You specified this account when you defined the currency in _Multicurrency Functionality:_     _Implementation Activity_. The system calculated the gain amount as the difference between the application     amount converted to the base currency by using the exchange rate of the debit adjustment and the     application amount converted to the base currency by using the exchange rate of the payment: (–$0.03 =     Round (C$5 * 0.7827176) – Round (C$5 * 0.78758762)). 

- The realized loss account was debited to the realized loss account of the currency ( _82010_ , which you     specified when you defined the currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) associated     with the debit adjustment. The system calculated the loss amount as the difference between the     application amount converted to the base currency by using the exchange rate of the payment and the     application amount converted to the base currency by using the exchange rate of the bill ($0.17 = Round     (C$50 * 0.78758762) – Round (C$50 * 0.78419072)).

## Paying Multicurrency Bills 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to pay a bill in a foreign currency by using the base currency and how to pay a bill in a foreign currency by using another foreign currency. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can apply payments created in one currency to documents created in another currency, and payments created in the base currency to documents created in a foreign currency. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create a bill in a foreign currency and a payment for it in the base currency 

- Create a bill in a foreign currency and a payment for it in another foreign currency 

- Review and analyze how the system applies payments to bills when the currency of the payment differs     from the currency of the bill 

- Override the cross rate used in the payment 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You process a bill in a foreign currency in the following cases: 

- You have created a bill in a foreign currency, but your company's cash account in this currency does not     have enough funds for payment. In this case, you can pay the bill in the base currency. 

- You have created a bill in a foreign currency, but your company's cash account in the base currency does not     have enough funds for payment. In this case, you can pay the bill in another foreign currency. 

#### Application of a Cross Rate 

 When the system applies the payment, if the currency of the document differs from the currency of the payment, the system uses a cross rate to calculate the amount of the invoice that is being paid. The cross rate determines how to convert the amount paid in the payment currency to the invoice currency. 

 By default, the cross rate is calculated as the effective rate of the invoice currency on the payment date divided by the payment rate. The default cross rate can be overridden in the payments that are applied to the invoices in the foreign currency. 

 You cannot override the cross rate of payment application to the documents in the base currency because realized gain or loss (RGOL) is not calculated for these documents. 

#### Calculation and Application of RGOL 

 When the payment is applied to an AP bill, and the payment and the bill are in different currencies, the system calculates realized gain or loss (RGOL) in the base currency by using the following formula: 

 RGOL Amount = Round (Payment Amount * Payment Rate) – Round (Payment Amount Converted * Bill Rate) 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Bills | 62 

 where Payment Amount Converted = Round (Payment Amount / Cross Rate) 

 That is, the realized gain or loss is calculated as the payment amount in the base currency minus the part of the bill that is being paid, which the system has converted to the base currency. 

 To get the amount of the bill that is being paid, the system has to convert the payment amount into the base currency by using the payment rate, and then into the bill currency by using the rate of the bill currency that was effective on the payment date. That is, to convert the payment amount into the bill currency, the system divides the payment amount by the cross rate. When the payment is applied, the balance of the bill is reduced by the payment amount converted into the base currency. 

 The RGOL amount calculated when a payment is applied to a bill is processed as follows: 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is negative, meaning that the application of the payment produces a gain,     the realized gain account associated with the bill currency is credited in the amount of (–1) * RGOL. 

- If the calculated RGOL amount is positive, meaning that the application of the payment produces a loss, the     realized loss account associated with the bill currency is debited in the amount of the calculated RGOL. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: Entry of the Payment Amount Instead of the Cross 

### Rate 

 When you create a payment on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form, you can enter the amount paid, cash discount taken, and withholding tax in the document currency. You don't need to manually calculate the cross rate based on application amounts. 

 On this form, you can also: 

- **Review the exact cross rate** used for payments sent to vendors 

- **Enter either a direct rate or a reciprocal rate** when applying payments to bills in different currencies For more details, see _Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Change the Payment Amount Instead of Cross Rate_. 

#### Cross Rate Selection 

 On the Documents to Apply tab of the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form, the value in the Cross Rate column is a link. If you click this link, the Cross Rate Selection dialog box opens. 

 This dialog box contains the Currency Unit Equivalents section, which includes the default direct and reciprocal rates. You can update the reciprocal rate, and the system will recalculate the direct rate. If you change the direct rate, the system will recalculate the reciprocal rate. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for paying multicurrency bills, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially process AP bills in a foreign currency, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Bills | 63 

 Form Steps to Perform 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Vendors (AP303000) Make sure that the vendor accounts for the vendors for which you will create AP documents have been defined. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rate for the currency of the AP document has been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing AP bills by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AP transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear     the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system consolidates     into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents     being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Payable Preferences_ (AP101000) form: 

- To cause all created AP bills to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check box     in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AP bills are assigned the _On_     _Hold_ status. 

- To make entering a vendor reference number in the **Vendor Ref.** box mandatory when creating an AP     bill on the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form, select the **Require Vendor Reference** check box in the     **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is cleared, you can leave the **Vendor Ref.** box empty when     creating an AP bill. 

- To cause AP bills to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process AP bills in a foreign currency by performing instructions similar to those described in Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using the Base Currency and Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using Another Currency.

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: Generated Transactions 

 To be able to pay an AP bill in a foreign currency by using the base currency or another foreign currency, you create and process a bill and a payment. To update vendor balances, the system generates the GL transactions described in the following sections. 

#### Transaction Generated for an AP Bill 

 When you create and release a one-line AP bill, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable account 0.00 Amount 

 Expense account Amount 0.00 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. 

#### Transactions Generated for a Bill Payment 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency for a bill in the base currency, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account 0.00 Amount 

 Accounts Payable account Amount 0.00 

 Realized Gain/Loss (bill currency) account Realized loss amount Realized gain amount 

 When you create and release a payment in a foreign currency for a bill in another foreign currency, the system generates the following GL transaction. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Cash account 0.00 Amount 

 Accounts Payable account Amount 0.00 

 Realized Gain/Loss (payment currency) account 

 Realized loss amount Realized gain amount

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using the Base 

### Currency 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of paying a bill in a foreign currency by using the base currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 16, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams purchased transport services from Big Green Trucks Ltd. in the amount of 450 in Canadian dollars (C$450). The chief accountant of SweetLife decided to pay the bill from the company's 10200WH account, which is in USD , because there were not enough funds in the account in CAD (which is a foreign currency of the company). SweetLife agreed with the vendor to pay the bill in USD at the 0.796 exchange rate (1 USD = 1.256 CAD), so that the payment amount of $358.20 would pay the bill in full. On January 30, 2026, SweetLife paid the bill in USD (which is the company’s base currency). 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to process the bill in CAD and pay it in USD. 

 Before you perform these actions, you will make changes to the Big Green Trucks Ltd. vendor’s settings so that bill processing can be performed in line with its currency-related preferences. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled:

6. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the bill. 

7. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Bills | 67 

8. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated transaction in the base     currency ( _USD_ ).     When the bill was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The AP account of the vendor ( _20000_ ) was credited in the total bill amount, which the system converted     to the base currency by using the document exchange rate ($352.89 = Round (C$450 * 0.78419072)). 

- The Expense account specified in the bill ( _81000_ ) was debited in the line amount, which the system     converted to the base currency by using the document exchange rate ($352.89 = Round (C$450 *     0.78419072)). 

#### Step 3: Creating a Payment for the Bill 

 To create a payment for the bill, do the following: 

1. Click the Business Date menu button, and select _1/30/2026_ from the calendar. 

2. Open the _Checks and Payments_ (AP302000) form. 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Payment_ 

- **Vendor** : _GREENTRUCK_ 

- **Payment Method** : _WIRE_ (inserted automatically when you selected the vendor) 

- **Cash Account** : _10200WH (Wholesale Checking)_ 

- **Currency** : _USD_ (inserted automatically based on the selected cash account) 

- **Application Date** : _1/30/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Description** : Transport services 

- **Payment Amount** : 358.20 

4. On the table toolbar of the **Documents To Apply** tab, click **Load Documents**. The bill dated 1/16/2026     appears in the table.     The payment is in the base currency because the specified cash account is maintained in the base currency.     The amount to be applied to the selected document is currently $352.22 (C$450 * 0.7827176), which is the     _CAD_ -to- _USD_ exchange rate that was effective on 1/16/2026. The system uses this rate as the default cross     rate between the currency of the payment ( _USD_ ) and currency of the bill ( _CAD_ ).     When the payment is applied to the bill, the bill will be fully paid, and its **Balance** will be equal to _0.00_ , while     the payment will still have an open balance in the amount of $5.98. To close both the bill and the payment,     you need to set the appropriate cross rate (0.796). Aer that, both the **Balance** of the bill and the **Unapplied**     **Balance** of the payment will be _0.00_ in both currencies. 

5. In the table, enter 0.796 in the **Cross Rate** column to use this rate in the payment application. Now     the amount in the base currency that will be applied to the bill ( **Amount Paid** ) is equal to the **Payment**     **Amount**. 

6. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

7. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

8. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated transaction.     When the payment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10200_ ) was credited in the amount of the payment     ($358.20). 

- The Accounts Payable account specified in the bill ( _20000_ ) was debited in the total amount of the bill,     which is the payment amount divided by the cross rate and multiplied by the bill rate, ($352.89 = Round     ($358.20 / 0.796 * 0.78419072)), to decrease the vendor's outstanding balance and close the bill. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Paying Multicurrency Bills | 68 

- The realized loss account of the bill currency ( _82010_ ), which you specified when you defined the _CAD_     currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was debited in the amount of the realized     loss, which is the amount of the payment in the base currency minus the original amount of the bill in     the base currency ($5.31 = $358.20 – $352.89). 

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using Another 

### Currency 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of paying a bill in a foreign currency by using another foreign currency. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that on January 17, 2026, SweetLife Fruits & Jams purchased consulting services from Big Green Trucks Ltd. in the amount of 220 euros (€220). ( EUR is a foreign currency of the company.) On January 30, SweetLife agreed with the vendor to pay half of the bill in CAD (which is the other foreign currency of the company) by using the 1.50 exchange rate (1 EUR = 1.50 CAD), so that the partial payment amount would be C$165. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to process the bill in EUR , partially pay it with a payment in CAD , and then print a multicurrency report. Before you perform these actions, you will make changes to the Big Green Trucks Ltd. vendor’s currency-related settings, which you initially specified in Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using the Base Currency , to allow the vendor’s preferred currency to be overridden. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the following features have been enabled: 

- _Standard Financials_ , which provides the standard financial functionality 

- _Multibranch Support_ , which supports multiple branches in your instance of Acumatica ERP 

- _Multicompany Support_ , which supports multiple companies within one tenant. 

- _Multicurrency Accounting_ , which enables multicurrency operations in the system 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been defined. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _HEADOFFICE_ branch of the _SWEETLIFE_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the _20000 (Accounts Payable)_ , _83000 (Realized Gain/Loss Currency)_     accounts have been created. 

- On the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form, the _GREENTRUCK_ vendor has been predefined. 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, Vendors (AP303000) form, you will update the currency-related settings of the vendor to prepare it for bill processing. On the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you will create and release a bill in EUR. On the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form, you will partially pay the bill in CAD , and review the generated GL transaction on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. On the Bills and Adjustments form, you will review the balance of the partially paid bill. Finally, you will run the AP Balance by Vendor MC (AP633000) report to review the outstanding balances of vendors.

If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

4. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 

5. Make sure that you have configured an account as described in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an_     _Account_. 

#### Step 1: Updating the Vendor's Settings 

 To update the vendor’s currency-related settings (which you updated in Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Pay a Foreign Currency Bill by Using the Base Currency ) to make it possible to process a bill in EUR , do the following: 

1. Open the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form. 

2. In the **Vendor ID** box, select _GREENTRUCK_. 

3. On the **Financial** tab ( **Financial Settings** section), make sure that _CAD_ is selected in the **Currency ID** box.     This is still the vendor’s preferred currency. 

4. Select the **Enable Currency Override** check box.     With this change, although _CAD_ will still be initially inserted into bills and adjustments of the vendor, the     currency can be overridden (as it will be in this activity to _EUR_ ). 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Save** to save your changes. 

#### Step 2: Creating and Releasing a Bill 

 To create and release a bill in the EUR currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Bill_ 

- **Vendor** : _GREENTRUCK_ 

- **Currency** : _EUR_ 

- **Date** : _1/17/2026_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Post Period** : _01-2026_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Description** : Consulting services 

3. On the **Details** tab, click **Add Row** , and in the added row, specify the following settings: 

- **Transaction Descr.** : Consulting services 

- **Ext. Cost** : 220.00 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Save**. 

5. In the Summary area, click **View Base** (right of the **Currency** box), and review the bill in the base currency.     The **Detail Total** in _USD_ is $251.14 (Round (€220 * 1.14155251), where 1.14155251 is the current _EUR_     exchange rate effective on the bill date). You cannot override the document rate, because the **Enable Rate**     **Override** check box is cleared on the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form for the vendor.

6. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the bill. 

#### Step 3: Creating a Partial Payment for the Bill 

 To create a partial payment for the bill, do the following: 

1. Open the _Checks and Payments_ (AP302000) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and in the Summary area, specify the following settings: 

- **Type** : _Payment_ 

- **Vendor** : _GREENTRUCK_ 

- **Payment Method** : _WIRE_ (inserted automatically when you selected the vendor) 

- **Cash Account** : _10215WH (Checking Account CAD)_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ (inserted automatically based on the selected cash account) 

- **Application Date** : _1/30/2026_ 

- **Application Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Description** : Partial payment on consulting services 

- **Payment Amount** : 165 

3. On the table toolbar of the **Documents to Apply** tab, click **Load Documents**. The bill dated 1/17/2026,     which you created in Step 2, appears in the table.     The calculated cross rate from _CAD_ to _EUR_ is 1.42477975 (1.2776 / 0.8967, which is the _CAD_ rate that was     effective on the payment date divided by the _EUR_ rate that was effective on the payment date). The amount     to be paid is the **Amount Paid (EUR)** divided by the **Cross Rate** and is currently €115.81 (Round (C$165 /     1.42477975)). 

4. Enter 1.50 in the **Cross Rate** column to change the cross rate to the one agreed on with the vendor, and     enter 165.00 in the **Amount Paid (EUR)** column. The **Balance** of the bill aer payment will be €110. 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Remove Hold** and then click **Release** to release the payment. 

6. On the **Financial** tab, click the **Batch Nbr.** link. 

7. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated batch in the base currency.     When the payment was released, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The checking account specified in the payment ( _10215_ ), which you created in _Multicurrency Functionality:_     _Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in the amount of the payment, which the system converted to the     base currency by using the payment rate ($129.15 = Round (C$165 * 0.7827176)). 

- The Accounts Payable account of the vendor ( _20000_ ) was debited in the amount in the base currency     deducted from the balance of the bill ($125.57 = Round (Round (C$165 / 1.5) * 1.14155251)). 

- The realized gain/loss account of the document currency ( _83000_ ), which you specified when you defined     the _EUR_ currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was debited in the amount of the     realized loss, which is the amount of the payment in the base currency minus the amount in the base     currency deducted from the balance of the bill ($3.58 = $129.15 – $125.57). 

#### Step 4: Reviewing the Bill Balance 

 To review the balance of the partially paid bill, do the following: 

1. Open the _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form. 

2. Open the bill to which you have applied the payment and review the **Applications** tab.     The payment in _CAD_ with the amount equivalent to €110.00 (C$129.15) was applied to the bill. The open     balance of the bill is €110.00; that is, half of the bill was paid with the payment.

#### Step 5: Printing a Multicurrency Report 

 To review the outstanding balance for the vendors and print a multicurrency report, do the following: 

1. Open the _AP Balance by Vendor MC_ (AP633000) form. 

2. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following parameters: 

- **Report Format** : _Open + Current Period_ 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE (SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center)_ (inserted by default) 

- **Financial Period** : _01-2026_ (inserted by default) 

- **Vendor** : Empty 

- **Include Applications** : Cleared 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report**. 

4. Review the generated report.     The report lists all the documents processed in the _01-2026_ period, along with the documents that are     open at the end of the period; the documents are grouped by vendor. For each document, you can review     the document balance in the document currency. Also, for each vendor, you can review the total of the     documents in each currency at the end of the period. 

 In a production environment, you would click Print on the form toolbar to print the multicurrency report. 

### Multicurrency Payment of Bills: To Change the Payment Amount Instead of Cross 

### Rate 

 This activity will walk you through the process of creating an AP bill in a foreign currency and paying it in another foreign currency. You will also change the amount paid in the payment currency, causing the system to recalculate the cross rate. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that SweetLife Fruits & Jams buys professional services from Space Computers, Ltd., which operates in a multicurrency environment. SweetLife’s base currency is USD, but it conducts business using foreign currencies— specifically, EUR and GBP. 

 On April 1, 2026, a bill for EUR 1000 was entered in the system, which was USD 1100 in the base currency. On April 15, 2026, SweetLife made a payment of GBP 840 to fully pay the bill. The exchange rates on the payment date were 1 USD = 1.299 GBP and 1 USD = 1.0799311 EUR. Thus, the default cross rate was 0.83135574. 

 Acting as a SweetLife accountant, you need to create a bill for EUR 1000, create a payment for GBP 840, and apply the payment to the bill to fully pay it.

 Processing Documents Between Companies with Different Base Currencies | 75 

## Processing Documents Between Companies with Different 

## Base Currencies 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to process an AR invoice and an AP bill between companies that use different base currencies. 

### Documents in Different Base Currencies: General Information 

 If the Multiple Base Currencies feature is enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the system converts each transaction to the base currency of the company by using the exchange rate that is effective on the transaction date. 

 On data entry forms, all branches involved in the transaction must have the same base currency. The system performs validation for manually created documents and for automatically generated documents. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Process an AR invoice involving branches of companies with different base currencies 

- Process an AP bill involving different branches of companies with different base currencies 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You process intercompany documents between branches with different base currencies if the companies have been implemented in the same tenant but have different base currencies. 

### Documents in Different Base Currencies: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing documents between companies that use different base currencies, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially process documents between companies with different base currencies, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) The Multibranch Support , Multicompany Support , Customer and Vendor Visibility Restriction , Multicurrency Accounting , and Multiple Base Currencies features have been enabled. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Documents Between Companies with Different Base Currencies | 76 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Multiple forms The necessary settings have been specified, as demonstrated in the examples of Multiple Base Currencies: Implementation Activity , Company Groups: Implementation Activity , Customer Visibility: To Restrict Visibility to a New Company , and Vendor Visibility: To Restrict Visibility to a New Company. 

 Non-Stock Items (IN202000) The CONSULT non-stock item has been defined. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of processing AR invoices by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- On the **Posting Settings** tab of the _General Ledger Preferences_ (GL102000) form: 

- To cause GL batches to be immediately posted aer they are released, select the **Automatically Post on**     **Release** check box. 

- To cause every AR and AP transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general     ledger, clear the **Generate Consolidated Batches** check box. If this check box is selected, the system     consolidates into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all     documents being released. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Receivable Preferences_ (AR101000) form: 

- To cause all created AR invoices to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check     box in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AR invoices are assigned     the _On Hold_ status. 

- To cause AR invoices to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

- On the **General Settings** tab of the _Accounts Payable Preferences_ (AP101000) form: 

- To cause all created AP bills to have the _Balanced_ status, clear the **Hold Documents on Entry** check box     in the **Data Entry Settings** section. If this check box is selected, the created AP bills are assigned the _On_     _Hold_ status. 

- To cause AP bills to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released, select the     **Automatically Post on Release** check box in the **Posting Settings** section. If this check box is cleared,     you have to post the batch aer you release the document. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process documents between companies with different base currencies by performing instructions similar to those described in Documents in Different Base Currencies: To Process an AR Invoice and Documents in Different Base Currencies: To Process an AP Bill. 

### Documents in Different Base Currencies: Generated Transactions 

 As you process AR and AP documents between companies with different base currencies, you create and release an AR invoice and an AP bill. To update the customer and vendor balances, the system generates the GL transactions described in the following sections. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Processing Documents Between Companies with Different Base Currencies | 77 

#### Transaction Generated for an AR Invoice 

 When you create and release an AR invoice, the system generates the following general ledger transaction.

 43000 (Related Company Sales) 

 The customer's sales account specified on the GL Accounts tab of the Customers form if Customer Location is selected in the Use Intercompany Sales Account From box on the Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. If Inventory Item is selected in this box, the system instead uses the sales account of the item specified on the GL Accounts tab of the Non-Stock Items (IN202000) or Stock Items (IN202500) form. 

 00.00 Amount 

 You can view the reference number of the GL batch on the Financial tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

#### Transaction Generated for an AP Bill 

 When you create and release an AP bill, the system generates the following general ledger transaction: 

 Account Source of Account Debit Credit 

 26010 (Accounts Payable Related Company) 

 The vendor's AP account specified on the GL Accounts tab of the Vendors (AP303000) form. 

 00.00 Amount

 Processing Documents Between Companies with Different Base Currencies | 80 

#### Story 

 Suppose that in January 2026, the MHEAD branch of the Muffins & Cakes company purchased 10 hours of consulting services from SweetLife Canada. Acting as Kimberly Gibbs, an employee who has access to the Muffins and SweetLife Canada companies, you need to extend the SLCANADA branch as a vendor and create an AP bill for the MHEAD branch. This bill is based on the invoice from SweetLife Canada. Because SweetLife Canada has an agreement with the MHEAD branch that they bill them in the US dollars, the corresponding bill in the MHEAD books should be in USD. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the _Multibranch Support_ , _Multicompany Support_ , _Customer_     _and Vendor Visibility Restriction_ , _Multicurrency Accounting_ , and _Multiple Base Currencies_ features have been     enabled.

## Revaluing Open AP Documents 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to revalue open AP documents created in foreign currencies. 

### Revaluation of AP Documents: General Information 

 If your company has vendors that use foreign currencies, you may process AP documents in foreign currencies and post transactions to the general ledger in foreign currencies. Because currency rates are changed over time, you may need to revalue denominated GL accounts and open AP documents. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Perform system setup for the revaluation of AP documents 

- Revalue open AP documents 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You perform the revaluation of open AP documents in the following cases: 

- You want to calculate unrealized gains or losses. 

- For reporting purposes, you need to determine the current value of AP documents in a foreign currency at     the end of a financial period. 

#### Rate Type Setup for Accounts Payable Revaluations 

 You specify the default rate types for AP revaluations in the AP Revaluation Type box on the Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. 

 You can assign a rate type to each particular vendor in the Curr. Rate Type box on the Financial tab of the Vendors (AP303000) form. If a rate type is assigned to a particular vendor, the system uses it for revaluations. 

 If the default rate type is not specified on the Currency Management Preferences form or for any vendor for which an account is selected for the revaluation, you will not be able to perform the revaluation. 

#### Revaluation of Open Documents 

 If On Post is selected in the Generate Reversing Entries box on the General Ledger Preferences (GL102000) form, before you start the revaluation, you should ensure that the next financial period is active on the Master Financial Calendar (GL201000) form. This is because the revaluation batch is an auto-reversing batch—that is, the system will automatically generate a reversing batch whose date is the first day of the next period. 

 You perform a revaluation of open AP documents on the Revalue AP Accounts (CM504000) form. On the form, you specify the period of revaluation, the date of revaluation, the foreign currency, and a description of the revaluation. You then select the particular accounts whose balances you want to revalue. For revaluation, the system uses the currency rate effective on the date of revaluation. 

 If needed, you can perform the AP revaluation more than once for the same period. Subsequent revaluation in the same period adjusts the results of the previous revaluation, and each revaluation generates an auto-reversing batch. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AP Documents | 83 

#### Revaluation Batches 

 Aer the revaluation is performed, the system creates a GL batch with the results of revaluation. The batch updates the unrealized gain (or loss) account specified for the currency with the calculated gain (or loss) amount. As the offset account, the system uses the AP provisioning account specified for the document currency. If the provisioning account is not specified for the currency for which you are performing the revaluation, the resulting unrealized gain or loss is posted directly to the vendor's AP account. 

 For details about generated GL batches, see Revaluation of AP Documents: Generated Transactions. 

#### Correction of AP Revaluation Transactions 

 The batches created on the Revalue AP Accounts (CM504000) cannot be reversed. 

 If you performed AP revaluation with incorrect settings such as the period or rate and need to correct the revaluation entries, you should run the process once again with correct settings. 

### Revaluation of AP Documents: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for performing revaluation of open AP documents, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially perform revaluation of open AP documents, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Chart of Accounts (GL202500) Check whether the necessary accounts have been created. 

 Master Financial Calendar (GL201000) Make sure that a financial period next to the one during which revaluation will occur has been opened in the master financial calendar. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rates have been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AP Documents | 84 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) Make sure that the accounts to which unrealized gains and losses are posted have been specified in the Unrealized Gain Account and Unrealized Loss Account boxes. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of revaluing open AP documents by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- To cause batches generated from currency management to be automatically posted to the general ledger,     on the _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form, select the **Automatically Post to GL on Release**     check box. 

- To cause unrealized gains and losses to be posted to a separate account instead of the AP account of the     vendor, specify the AP provisioning account for the needed currency in the **AP Provisioning Account** box on     the _Currency Management Preferences_ form. 

- To cause unrealized gains and losses to be posted to the accounts specific for the vendor class, select the     needed accounts in the **Unrealized Gain Account** and **Unrealized Loss Account** boxes on the **GL Accounts**     tab of the _Vendor Classes_ (AP201000) form. 

 If these boxes on the Vendor Classes form are le empty, the system will post unrealized gains and losses to the account for the currency, which is specified in the Unrealized Gain Account and Unrealized Loss Account box on the GL Accounts tab of the Currencies (CM202000) form. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you revalue balances of open AP documents by performing instructions similar to those described in Revaluation of AP Documents: Process Activity. 

### Revaluation of AP Documents: Generated Transactions 

 When you a perform revaluation of open AP documents, the system creates a revaluation batch with the results of the revaluation. This auto-reversing batch is automatically reversed on the date at the beginning of the next financial period. 

 The batch updates the unrealized gain or loss account with the calculated gain or loss amount. The account updated by the batch is selected by the system in the following order of priority: 

1. The account for the vendor class, which is specified in the **Unrealized Gain Account** or **Unrealized Loss**     **Account** box on the **GL Accounts** tab of the _Vendor Classes_ (AP201000) form 

2. If the applicable box on the _Vendor Classes_ form is empty, the account for the currency, which is specified     in the **Unrealized Gain Account** or **Unrealized Loss Account** box on the **GL Accounts** tab of the _Currencies_     (CM202000) form 

 The system calculates the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance in the Difference column for each account in the selected currency. 

 Revaluation gains and losses are included in the net income on the period-end reports. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AP Documents | 85 

#### Transactions Generated for Revaluation Loss 

 If the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance is positive, the revaluation has resulted in losses, and the system generates a batch that posts to the accounts shown in the following tables. 

 Depending on whether the provisioning account has been specified, the system generates either of the following batches. 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Not Been Specified 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable account 00.00 Amount 

 Unrealized Loss account Amount 00.00 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Been Specified 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable Provisioning account 00.00 Amount 

 Unrealized Loss account Amount 00.00 

#### Transactions Generated for Revaluation Gains 

 If the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance is negative, the revaluation has resulted in gains, and the system generates a batch that posts to the accounts shown in the following tables. 

 Depending on whether the provisioning account has been specified, the system generates either of the following batches. 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Not Been Specified 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable account Amount 00.00 

 Unrealized Loss account 00.00 Amount 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Been Specified 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Payable Provisioning account Amount 00.00

- **To Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Suppress Zero Balances** : Selected 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report**. 

4. In the generated report, review the balance of the _20000 (Accounts Payable)_ account before the revaluation. 

#### Step 3: Reviewing the Vendors' Balances Before Revaluation 

 To review the balances of the vendors before revaluation, do the following: 

1. Open the _Vendor Summary_ (AP401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted by default) 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Vendor Class** : _INTLCA - Canadian Vendors_ 

- **Split by Currency** : Selected 

- **Vendors with Balance Only** : Selected 

3. Review the balances of the _GREENTRUCK_ and _MAPLELEAF_ vendors.

For the _MAPLELEAF (MapleLeaf Ads Co.)_ vendor, the open balance at     the end of the period is C$95.00, which is $74.51 in the base currency. 

#### Step 4: Performing Revaluation of AP Documents in EUR 

 To perform revaluation of open AP documents in the EUR currency, do the following: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AP Documents | 88 

1. Open the _Revalue AP Accounts_ (CM504000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted by default) 

- **Fin. Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Currency Effective Date** : _1/31/2026_ 

- **Currency** : _EUR_ 

- **Description** : AP Revaluation 01-2026 EUR For the only listed vendor, the columns of the table provide the following information. 

- The **Foreign Currency Balance** column shows the outstanding balance of the vendor in the foreign     currency (€110.00). 

- The **Original Balance** column shows the outstanding balance of the vendor in the base currency     ($125.57). 

- The **Currency Rate** column shows the rate that will be used for revaluation—that is, the rate of the _SPOT_     type that was effective on the date of revaluation. 

- The **Revalued Balance** column shows the resulting balance aer revaluation: $122.67 = Round (€110.00 /     0.8967). 

- The **Difference** column shows the difference between the **Revalued Balance** and **Original Balance**     values, which is the resulting unrealized gain (if the amount is negative) or loss (if the amount is positive).     Currently, there is an unrealized gain in the amount of $2.90 ($125.57 – $122.67). 

3. In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the only row to select _GREENTRUCK_ ( _Big Green Trucks Ltd._ ) for     revaluation.     The total amount of the unrealized gain or loss posted by the records selected in the table is shown in the     **Revaluation Total** box in the Selection area of the form. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Revalue** to perform the revaluation.     The system revalues the balances of the open documents of the _GREENTRUCK_ vendor based on the     currency rate of the _SPOT_ type effective on the date of revaluation. Then the system generates and posts the     revaluation transaction, and opens it on the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form. 

5. On this form, review the transaction that was generated on revaluation in the base currency. Notice that the     **Auto Reversing** check box in the Summary area is selected. The generated batch is auto-reversing, because     revaluations are performed for reporting purposes. At the start of the next reporting period, the batch will     be reversed automatically.     When the revaluation transaction was posted, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The AP account ( _20000_ ) was debited in the amount of unrealized gain ($2.90) to revalue the account     balance. 

- The Unrealized Gain/Loss Currency account specified for the _EUR_ currency ( _84000_ ), which you specified     when you defined the _EUR_ currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in     the amount of unrealized gain ($2.90) to record the revaluation. 

#### Step 5: Performing Revaluation of AP Documents in CAD 

 To perform revaluation of open AP documents in the CAD currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Revalue AP Accounts_ (CM504000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Fin. Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Currency Effective Date** : 1/31/2026 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->

- **Description** : AP Revaluation 01-2026 CAD 

3. In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the only row to select _MAPLELEAF (MapleLeaf Ads Co.)_ for     revaluation.     The revaluation will produce an unrealized gain in the amount of $0.15, which is also shown in the     **Revaluation Total** box in the Selection area of the form. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Revalue** to perform the revaluation. 

5. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the revaluation transaction in the base     currency. 

#### Step 6: Reviewing the Unrealized Gains or Losses 

 To review the unrealized gains or losses for the vendor accounts and the Accounts Payable account, do the following: 

1. Open the _AP Balance by GL Account_ (AP632000) form. 

2. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following parameters: 

- **Report Format** : _Vendor Summary_ 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Financial Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Include Applications** : Cleared 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report** and review the report.     For the _GREENTRUCK (Big Green Trucks Ltd.)_ vendor, the report shows an unrealized gain in the amount of     $2.90. For the _MAPLELEAF (MapleLeaf Ads Co.)_ vendor, the report shows an unrealized gain in the amount of     $0.15. The total unrealized gain for the Accounts Payable account is $3.05 ($–2.90 + –$0.15). 

#### Step 7: Reviewing the Revaluation Transactions 

 To review the revaluation transactions posted to the general ledger, do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Cleared 

3. Review the form and the balance of the Accounts Payable account. 

4. In the table, click the row with the _20000 (Accounts Payable)_ account and on the form toolbar, click **Account**     **Details**. 

5. On the _Account Details_ (GL404000) form, which opens, specify _01-2026_ to _02-2026_ in the **Period Range** boxes. 

6. In the table, click the **Module** column and in the dialog box that opens, clear all the check boxes except **CM**     to review only transactions related to currency management. Click **Apply**. 

7. Review the entries displayed in the table.     The table displays the revaluation batches, as well as the corresponding reversing batches, which are     automatically generated at the start of the financial period aer the period of revaluation. These batches     offset each other, so the balance of the account becomes the same as it was before the revaluation.

 You perform the revaluation of open AR documents in the following cases: 

- You want to calculate unrealized gains or losses. 

- For reporting purposes, you need to determine the current value of AR documents in a foreign currency at     the end of a financial period. 

#### Rate Type Setup for Accounts Receivable Revaluations 

 You specify the default rate types for AR revaluations in the AR Revaluation Type box on the Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. 

 You can assign a rate type to each particular customer in the Curr. Rate Type box on the Financial tab of the Customers (AR303000) form. If a rate type is assigned to a particular customer, the system uses it for revaluations. 

 If the default rate type is not specified on the Currency Management Preferences form or for any customer for which an account is selected for the revaluation, you will not be able to perform the revaluation. 

#### Revaluation of Open Documents 

 If On Post is selected in the Generate Reversing Entries box on the General Ledger Preferences (GL102000) form, before you start the revaluation, you should ensure that the next financial period is active on the Master Financial Calendar (GL201000) form. This is because the revaluation batch is an auto-reversing batch—that is, the system will automatically generate a reversing batch whose date is the first day of the next period. 

 You perform a revaluation of open AR documents on the Revalue AR Accounts (CM505000) form. On the form, you specify the period of revaluation, the date of revaluation, the foreign currency, and a description of the revaluation. You then select the particular accounts whose balances you want to revalue. For revaluation, the system uses the currency rate effective on the date of revaluation. 

 If needed, you can perform the revaluation of AR accounts more than once for the same period. Subsequent revaluation in the same period adjusts the results of the previous revaluation, and each revaluation generates an auto-reversing batch.

#### Revaluation Batches 

 When an AR revaluation is performed, the system creates a GL batch with the results of the revaluation. The batch updates the unrealized gain (or loss) account specified for the currency with the calculated gain (or loss) amount on the Currencies (CM202000) form. The system calculates the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance in the Difference column for each account in the selected currency. If the difference is positive, the revaluation has resulted in gains, and if the difference is negative, the revaluation has resulted in losses. 

 As the offset account, the system uses the AR provisioning account specified for the document currency. If the provisioning account is not specified for the currency for which you are performing the revaluation, the resulting unrealized gain or loss is posted directly to the customer's AR account. For details about generated GL batches, see Revaluation of AR Documents: Generated Transactions. 

#### Correction of AR Revaluation Transactions 

 The batches created on the Revalue AR Accounts (CM505000) form cannot be reversed. 

 If you performed AR revaluation with incorrect settings such as the period or rate and need to correct the revaluation entries, you should run the process once again with correct settings. 

### Revaluation of AR Documents: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for performing revaluation of open AR documents, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially perform revaluation of open AR documents, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials and Multicurrency Accounting features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring the multicurrency functionality, see Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity. 

 Chart of Accounts (GL202500) Check whether the necessary accounts have been created. 

 Master Financial Calendar (GL201000) Make sure that a financial period next to the one during which revaluation will occur has been opened in the master financial calendar. 

 Currency Rates (CM301000) Make sure that the effective currency rates have been defined. 

 For details, see Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates and Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Set Up Refreshing of Rates. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AR Documents | 93 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) Make sure that the accounts to which unrealized gains and losses are posted have been specified in the Unrealized Gain Account and Unrealized Loss Account boxes. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of revaluing open AR documents by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- To cause batches generated from currency management to be automatically posted to the general ledger,     on the _Currency Management Preferences_ (CM101000) form, select the **Automatically Post to GL on Release**     check box. 

- To cause unrealized gains and losses to be posted to a separate account instead of the AR account of the     customer, specify the AR provisioning account for the needed currency in the **AR Provisioning Account** box     on the _Currency Management Preferences_ form. 

- To cause unrealized gains and losses to be posted to the accounts specific for the customer class, select the     needed accounts in the **Unrealized Gain Account** and **Unrealized Loss Account** boxes on the **GL Accounts**     tab of the _Customer Classes_ (AR201000) form. 

 If these boxes on the Customer Classes form are le empty, the system will post unrealized gains and losses to the account for the currency, which is specified in the Unrealized Gain Account and Unrealized Loss Account box on the GL Accounts tab of the Currencies (CM202000) form. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you revalue balances of open AP documents by performing instructions similar to those described in Revaluation of AR Documents: Process Activity. 

### Revaluation of AR Documents: Generated Transactions 

 When you perform a revaluation of open AR documents, the system creates a revaluation batch with the results of the revaluation. This auto-reversing batch is automatically reversed on the date at the beginning of the next financial period. 

 The batch updates the unrealized gain or loss account with the calculated gain or loss amount. The account updated by the batch is selected by the system in the following order of priority: 

1. The account for the customer class, which is specified in the **Unrealized Gain Account** or **Unrealized Loss**     **Account** box on the **GL Accounts** tab of the _Customer Classes_ (AR201000) form 

2. If the applicable box on the _Customer Classes_ form is empty, the account for the currency, which is specified     in the **Unrealized Gain Account** or **Unrealized Loss Account** box on the **GL Accounts** tab of the _Currencies_     (CM202000) form 

 The system calculates the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance in the Difference column for each account in the selected currency. 

 Revaluation gains and losses are included in the net income on the period-end reports. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->

#### Transactions Generated for Revaluation Loss 

 If the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance is negative, the revaluation has resulted in losses, and the system generates a batch that posts to the accounts shown in the following tables. 

 Depending on whether the provisioning account has been specified, the system generates either of the following batches. 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Not Been Specified 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Accounts Receivable account 00.00 Amount 

 Unrealized Loss account Amount 00.00 

 Table: Revaluation Batch if the Provisioning Account Has Been Specified

7. On the form toolbar, click **Save** to save your changes. 

#### Step 2: Running the Trial Balance Summary Report 

 To review the balance of the 11000 (Accounts Receivable) account before the revaluation, do the following: 

1. Open the _Trial Balance Summary_ (GL632000) form. 

2. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following parameters: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ 

- **From Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **To Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Suppress Zero Balances** : Selected 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report**. 

4. In the generated report, review the balance of the _11000 (Accounts Receivable)_ account before the     revaluation. 

#### Step 3: Performing Revaluation of AR Documents in EUR

<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AR Documents | 97 

3. In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the only row to select _EASYDINER (EasyDiner Co.)_ for     revaluation.     The total amount of unrealized loss posted by the records selected in the table is shown in the **Revaluation**     **Total** box in the Selection area of the form. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Revalue** to perform the revaluation.     The system revalues the balances of the open documents of the _EASYDINER_ customer based on the currency     rate of the _SPOT_ type effective on the date of revaluation. Then the system generates and posts the     revaluation transaction, and opens it on the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form. 

5. On this form, review the transaction that was generated on revaluation in the base currency. Notice that the     **Auto Reversing** check box in the Summary area is selected; the generated batch is auto-reversing, because     revaluations are performed for reporting purposes. At the start of the next reporting period, the batch will     be reversed automatically.     When the revaluation transaction was automatically posted, the following actions were performed in the     system: 

- The AR account ( _11000_ ) was credited in the amount of unrealized loss ($0.82) to revalue the account     balance. 

- The Unrealized Gain/Loss Currency account specified for the _EUR_ currency ( _84000_ ), which you specified     when you defined the _EUR_ currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was debited in     the amount of the unrealized loss ($0.82) to record the revaluation. 

#### Step 4: Performing Revaluation of AR Documents in CAD 

 To perform revaluation of open AR documents in the CAD currency, do the following: 

1. Open the _Revalue AR Accounts_ (CM505000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted by default) 

- **Fin. Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Currency Effective Date** : _1/29/2026_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ 

- **Description** : AR Revaluation 01-2026 CAD For the only listed customer, the columns of the table provide the following information: 

- The **Foreign Currency Balance** column shows the outstanding balance of the customer in the foreign     currency (C$200). 

- The **Original Balance** column shows the outstanding balance of the customer in the base currency     ($156.54) 

- The **Currency Rate** column shows the rate that will be used for revaluation (1.275200) 

- The **Revalued Balance** column shows the resulting balance aer revaluation ($156.84 = Round (C$200 /     1.275200)). 

- The **Difference** column shows the difference between the **Revalued Balance** and **Original Balance** ,     which is the resulting unrealized gain (if the amount is positive) or loss (if the amount is negative).     Currently, there is an unrealized gain in the amount of $0.30 ($156.84 – $156.54). 

3. In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the only row to select the _11000_ AR account for revaluation.     The total amount of the unrealized gain posted by the record selected in the table is shown in the     **Revaluation Total** box in the Selection area of the form. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Revalue** to perform the revaluation of the selected account. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Open AR Documents | 98 

 The system revalues the balances of the open documents of the MINTSTORE customer based on the currency rate of the SPOT type that was effective on the date of revaluation. Then the system generates the revaluation transaction and opens it on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. 

5. On the _Journal Transactions_ form, review the transaction generated on revaluation in the base currency.     Notice that **Auto-Reversing** check box in the Summary area is selected; the generated batch is auto-     reversing, because revaluations are performed for reporting purposes. In the start of the next reporting     period, the batch will be reversed automatically.     When the revaluation batch was posted, the following actions were performed in the system: 

- The AR Provisioning account specified for the currency of revaluation ( _11500_ ) was debited in the amount     of the unrealized gain ($0.30). 

- The Unrealized Gain/Loss Currency account ( _84000_ ), which you specified when you defined the _CAD_     currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in the amount of the     unrealized gain ($0.30). 

#### Step 5: Reviewing the Balances of Accounts Receivable and AR Provisioning Aer the Revaluation 

 To review the balances of the Accounts Receivable and AR Provisioning accounts aer the revaluation, do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Cleared 

3. In the table, review the ending balance of the _11000 (Accounts Receivable)_ account.     The AR balance is $15,994.55, because the _EUR_ revaluation resulted in a realized gain and was recorded     to the Accounts Receivable account. The result of the _CAD_ revaluation was a realized gain ($0.30) and was     recorded to the _11500 (AR Provisioning)_ account. 

4. In the table, click the row with the _11500 (AR Provisioning)_ account and on the form toolbar, click **Account**     **Details**. 

5. On the _Account Details_ (GL404000) form, which opens, specify _01-2026_ to _02-2026_ in the **Period Range** boxes     and review the entries displayed in the table.     The table displays the revaluation batch, as well as the corresponding reversing batch, which is     automatically generated at the start of the financial period aer the period of revaluation. These batches     offset each other, so the balance of the account becomes $0.00, as it was before the revaluation.

## Revaluing Bank Accounts 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to revalue a bank account denominated in a foreign currency. 

### Revaluation of Bank Accounts: General Information 

 General ledger revaluation is performed for accounts denominated in a foreign currency. Revaluation reflects changes in currency rates between the date when a journal entry in the foreign currency was created and the date of revaluation. GL revaluation is performed with respect to the base currency. Gains or losses resulting from revaluation are posted to the revaluation gain or loss account that is specified for the currency in which the account is denominated. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to revalue a bank account denominated in a foreign currency. 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You perform a revaluation of a GL account denominated in a foreign currency in the following cases: 

- You want to calculate unrealized gains or losses. 

- You need to update the balance of a bank account denominated in a foreign currency. 

#### Configuration for GL Revaluations 

 For each denominated account, you can specify a rate type in the Revaluation Rate Type column on the Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form, so that for revaluation, the system uses the currency rate of the specified type. If you do not assign a rate type to an account, the system uses the default rate type, which you specify in the GL Revaluation Rate Type box on the Currency Management Preferences (CM506000) form. For details on the denominated accounts, see Denominated Accounts. 

 For each foreign currency, you select the accounts to which the system posts gains and losses from revaluations in the Revaluation Gain and Loss Accounts section on the Currencies (CM202000) form. 

#### Revaluation of GL Accounts Denominated in a Foreign Currency 

 You revalue the GL accounts denominated in a foreign currency on the Revalue GL Accounts (CM506000) form. On the form, you specify the period of revaluation, the date of revaluation, the foreign currency, and a description of the revaluation. You can select particular accounts whose balances you want to revalue or perform revaluation for all available accounts on the form. For revaluation, the system uses the currency rate that was effective on the date of revaluation. 

 Although the Revalue GL Accounts form may show inactive accounts—those with the Active check box cleared on the Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form—these accounts cannot be selected for revaluation. 

 You can run GL revaluations as many times as you need to. Each time you perform a revaluation, the balance of the denominated account in the base currency is updated by the calculated difference. Each subsequent revaluation adjusts the results of the previous one. 

 Gains and losses calculated for GL revaluations are generally included in the net income for the period. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Bank Accounts | 101 

#### Reversal of Revaluation Transactions 

 If a GL transaction generated on the Revalue GL Accounts (CM506000) form requires correction, you can reverse it using the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. 

 To reverse a GL transaction generated during revaluation of GL accounts, you perform the following actions: 

1. On the _Journal Transactions_ form, you open the GL revaluation batch that you want to reverse. 

2. On the More menu, you click **Reverse**. The system creates a reversing batch, which is a copy of the original     batch with the debit and credit amounts swapped to offset the original transaction. 

3. Optional: You edit the **Description** box for the batch. All the other boxes are read-only. 

4. You release the reversing batch by clicking **Release** on the form toolbar. 

 For details on reversing transactions, see Reversing Transactions: General Information. 

 You cannot reverse batches created on the Revalue AP Accounts (CM504000) and Revalue AR Accounts (CM505000) forms. 

 If you performed AR or AP revaluation with incorrect settings such as the period or rate and need to correct the revaluation entries, you should run the process once again with correct settings. For more details, see Revaluation of AP Documents: General Information and Revaluation of AR Documents: General Information. 

### Revaluation of Bank Accounts: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for performing revaluation of a bank account, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.

The system     will use the default rate type specified in the **GL Revaluation Rate Type** box on the _Currency Management_     _Preferences_ form. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you revalue the balance of a bank account by performing instructions similar to those described in Revaluation of Bank Accounts: Process Activity. 

### Revaluation of Bank Accounts: Generated Transactions 

 When you perform a revaluation of a bank account, the system calculates the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance in the Difference column on the Revalue GL Accounts (CM506000) form for each denominated account in the selected currency. 

#### Transaction Generated for Revaluation Gain 

 If the difference between the revalued balance and the original balance is positive, the revaluation results in gains, and the system generates a batch that posts to the accounts shown in the following table. 

 Account Debit Credit 

 Denominated account Amount 00.00 

 Revaluation Gain account 00.00 Amount 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Bank Accounts | 103

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, you will review the revaluation rate type specified for the 10215 account on the Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form. On the Account Summary (GL401000) form, you will review the balance of the account, which is denominated in CAD , before its revaluation. (You created this GL account and the corresponding cash account in Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an Account .) On the Revalue GL Accounts (CM506000) form, you will revalue the denominated account and review the GL transaction generated by the system on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. Finally, you will review the updated balance of the denominated account on the Account Summary form. 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, do the following:

 Revaluing Bank Accounts | 104 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the _U100_ dataset preloaded, and sign in as an accountant Anna     Johnson by using the _johnson_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that     the _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

3. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 

4. Make sure that you have configured an account as described in _Multicurrency Cash Accounts: To Configure an_     _Account_. 

5. Make sure that you have processed a funds transfer as described in _Multicurrency Funds Transfers: Process_     _Activity_. 

#### Step 1: Reviewing the Revaluation Rate Type 

 To review the revaluation rate type for the account denominated in CAD , do the following: 

1. Open the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form. 

2. In the **Revaluation Rate Type** column, review the revaluation rate type in the row with the _10215_ account.     The revaluation rate type should be _SPOT_. 

 If the revaluation rate type is not specified for a particular account, for the revaluation of this account, the system uses the default rate specified in the GL Revaluation Rate Type box of the Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. 

#### Step 2: Reviewing the Balance of the Denominated Account Before Revaluation 

 To review the balance of the 10215 account, which is denominated in CAD , do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Selected 

3. Review the balance of _10215 (Checking Account CAD)_.     The ending balance of the denominated _10215_ checking account for the specified period is $336.75, which     is C$430.23 in the currency of denomination. Notice that the **Currency ID** column contains _CAD_ for this     account. 

#### Step 3: Revaluing the Bank Account 

 To revalue the bank account denominated in CAD , do the following: 

1. Open the _Revalue GL Accounts_ (CM506000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Fin. Period** : _01-2026_ 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Revaluing Bank Accounts | 105 

- **Currency Effective Date** : _1/24/2026_ 

- **Currency** : _CAD_ 

- **Description** : GL Revaluation 01-2026 CAD 

3. Select the unlabeled check box in the only row in the table, and on the form toolbar, click **Revalue** to     perform the revaluation for the selected account.     The system generates a revaluation transaction and opens it on the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form. 

4. On this form, review the revaluation transaction in the base currency. Notice that the **Auto Reversing** check     box in the Summary area is cleared. The created batch is not auto-reversing and thus will not be reversed at     the start of the next period.     When the revaluation transaction was automatically posted, the following actions were performed in the     system: 

- The revalued _10215_ checking account was debited in the amount of the calculated revaluation gain     ($0.63). 

- The revaluation gain/loss account specified for the CAD currency ( _84010_ ), which you specified when     you defined the _CAD_ currency in _Multicurrency Functionality: Implementation Activity_ ) was credited in the     amount of the calculated revaluation gain ($0.63). 

#### Step 4: Reviewing the Balance of the Denominated Account Aer the Revaluation 

 To review the balance of the 10215 account denominated in CAD, do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Ledger** : _ACTUAL_ 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Selected 

3. Review the table.     The ending balance of the denominated _10215_ checking account is now $337.38, which is C$430.23 revalued     by the system by using the _CAD_ exchange rate effective on 1/24/2026. 

4. Click the row with the _84010 (Cash Account Revaluation Gain/Loss CAD)_ account and on the form toolbar,     click **Account Details**. 

5. Review the _Account Details_ (GL404000) form, which opens. The revaluation gain amount has been credited     to the _84010_ account.

## Translating Financial Statements 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to translate account balances to a foreign currency and to review and analyze the translation worksheets and transactions generated by the system. 

### Translation of Financial Statements: General Information 

 In Acumatica ERP, you may need to restate account balances from the base currency (or a foreign currency) to any foreign currency configured for use in the system. This process of restating account balances from one currency (base or foreign) to another foreign currency is called translation and is used for reporting purposes. 

 For each financial period, to perform a translation, you first prepare the translation—that is, you specify the translation settings and create a translation worksheet in the system. You then check the translation worksheet, make corrections (if necessary), and release the worksheet. 

 To enable translation of financial statements in the system, the Multicurrency Accounting and Translation of Financial Statements features must be enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Prepare a translation in the system 

- Edit the prepared translation worksheet 

- Release the translation 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You perform the translation of financial statements if your company is a subsidiary of a larger entity that operates in a different currency, and your company's financial statements are included in the parent entity's consolidated statements, which are prepared in a different currency. 

#### Translation Steps 

 In general, the translation process consists of the following steps: 

1. You configure the system for translation, as described in _Translation Definitions: Implementation Activity_. 

2. You check and update (if necessary) the effective currency rates from the currency of the account to be     converted to the reporting currency for the date of translation on the _Currency Rates_ (CM301000) form. For     details on currency rates, see _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: General Information_. 

3. You prepare a translation for a particular financial period on the _Prepare Translation_ (CM501000) form. When     the system prepares the translation by using the specified translation definition, it generates a translation     worksheet and shows it on the _Translation Worksheets_ (CM304000) form. For details, see _Translation of_     _Financial Statements: Process Activity_. 

4. You review, correct (if necessary), and release the translation worksheet on the _Translation Worksheets_ form.     For a defined translation definition, subsequent translations for the same financial period are incremental:     The current translation adjusts the result of the previous released translation to match the current one.     When the translation is released, an appropriate batch of adjusting transactions is created. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 107 

5. If the **Automatically Post to GL on Release** check box is cleared on the _Currency Management Preferences_     (CM101000) form, you post the translation batch on the _Post Transactions_ (GL502000) form.     Gains or losses resulting from translation are posted to the translation gain or loss account (and     subaccount, if subaccounts are used in your system) specified in the **Translation Gain and Loss Accounts**     section of the **GL Accounts** tab of the _Currencies_ (CM202000) form. 

6. You review the translated account balances for the ledger and period on the _Account Summary_ (GL401000)     form. 

#### Translation Preparation 

 For each financial period for which you want to translate balances, you prepare a translation on the Prepare Translation (CM501000) form. On this form, you specify the following settings: 

- In the **Fin. Period** box: The financial period for which the translation is to be performed 

- In the **Translation ID** box: The translation definition to be used for translation 

- In the **Currency Effective Date** box: The effective date of the currency exchange rate to be used for     translation 

- In the **Description** box: A brief description of the translation In the Summary area of the _Prepare Translation_ form, the system automatically fills in the settings of the selected translation definition (that is, the source ledger and currency and the destination ledger and currency). The table displays the currency rates that will be used in the translation. These are the rates of different rate types that are effective on the translation date. 

 Aer you have specified the settings for the translation, you click the Create Translation button on the form toolbar. The system creates the translation worksheet, which shows the translated account balances, on the Translation Worksheets (CM304000) form. 

 The system will prevent you from preparing a translation and will display an error message in any of the following cases: 

- There is an unreleased translation worksheet for the destination ledger and the branch used in the selected     translation ID, if a branch is specified in the translation definition. 

- There is an unreleased translation worksheet for the destination ledger in the selected translation ID, if no     branch is specified in the translation definition. 

- There are unposted batches in the destination ledger for the branch used in the selected translation ID, if a     branch is specified in the translation definition. 

- There are unposted batches in the destination ledger, if no branch is specified in the translation definition. 

#### Translation Worksheet Editing 

 Before you release a translation worksheet, you can view it on the Translation Worksheets (CM304000) form. On this form, the Source Amount column shows the amount to be translated: the PTD balance for the accounts translated with the PTD Balance method, and the ending balance for the period for the accounts translated with the YTD Balance method. These accounts and the translation methods have been specified in a translation definition related to the worksheet on the Translation Definition (CM203000) form. 

 The Translated Amount column shows the source amount that the system converted by using the specified currency rate as follows: 

- For the accounts translated with the _YTD Balance_ method, this is the account balance at the end of the     period in the reporting ledger. 

- For the accounts translated with the _PTD Balance_ method, this is the account period-to-date balance for the     period in the reporting ledger. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 108 

 The Transaction Debit Amount and Transaction Credit Amount columns show the amount in which the account will be debited or credited in the translation batch to yield the needed balance. 

 Before you release a translation worksheet, you can manually edit the worksheet, if needed. To do so, on the Translation Worksheets form, you edit the amounts in the Transaction Debit Amount and Transaction Credit Amount columns. 

 As you adjust the values, the credit total and debit total on this form change synchronously to reflect the changes, because one of them contains the translation gain or loss. 

#### Translation Release 

 To release a single prepared translation worksheet, while viewing the worksheet on the Translation Worksheets (CM304000) form, you click Release on the form toolbar. You can also release multiple prepared translation worksheets on the Release Translations (CM502000) form. 

 Before you release a translation, you should make sure that you have released the translation for the previous periods. If any periods were skipped, you will see incorrect balances of the accounts that have been translated with the PTD Balance method selected on the Translation Definition (CM203000) form, and that have nonzero PTD balances for the skipped periods. 

 On release, the system generates a currency management batch for each translation. If the Automatically Post to GL on Release check box is selected on the Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form, the batch is posted to the reporting ledger. If this check box is cleared, you need to post the batch manually to the general ledger. 

#### Correction of a Released Translation 

 Sometimes aer a translation is performed for a period, some new transactions are posted to the actual ledger in this period. In this case, you have to perform the translation (that is, prepare and release it) one more time for that period; subsequent translations for the same period will adjust the account balance if the account balance has changed. 

 If you have used the wrong currency rate in the translation, you should change the rate to the correct one and prepare and release the translation. 

#### Translation Workflow 

 The diagram below illustrates how the system performs the translation of the account balances by using the EUR translation definition. For details on configuring this translation definition, see Translation Definitions: Implementation Activity. The system translates assets, liabilities, income, and expenses by using the methods and currency rates of the rate types that are specified in the translation definition. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 109 

 Figure: Translation process 

 The Year-to-Date (YTD) Net Income account is not included in the translation definition, because in the reporting ledger, just as in the actual ledger, this account accumulates the difference between amounts posted to income and expense accounts and is updated by every transaction posted to these accounts. Thus, to get the translated balance of the YTD Net Income account in the reporting ledger, you translate the balances of the income and expense accounts, and then the system calculates the account balance based on the translated amounts. 

 To get the correct translated balance of the Retained Earnings account in the reporting ledger, you need to translate the period-to-date (PTD) balances of income and expense accounts in each period, starting from the very first one. In addition, you need to translate the transactions that were posted manually to the Retained Earnings account (if any). These transactions update the account PTD balance in the transaction period, and the system would translate the account balance by using the PTD Balance method selected for the account in the translation definition. That is why you have to start translations from the first period in which the company begins operations in Acumatica ERP, which is 12-2025 for the company used in the activities of this guide. 

### Translation of Financial Statements: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for translating financial statements, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, you will prepare a translation for December 2025 on the Prepare Translation (CM501000) form and release it on the Translation Worksheets (CM304000) form. You will then review the balances of the reporting ledger on the Account Summary (GL401000) form. 

 Next, you will prepare a translation for January 2026 on the Prepare Translation form, release it on the Translation Worksheets form, and analyze how the system updated the balances. 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, do the following: 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the _U100_ dataset preloaded, and sign in as an accountant Anna     Johnson by using the _johnson_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, click the Business     Date menu button, and select _12/31/2025_ from the calendar. 

3. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that     the _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the Company     and Branch Selection menu button to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click     _SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_. 

4. Make sure that the multicurrency accounting functionality has been configured as described in _Multicurrency_     _Functionality: Implementation Activity_ and _Configuration of Rate Types and Rates: To Configure Rates_. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 112 

5. Make sure that you have created a translation definition as described in _Translation Definitions:_     _Implementation Activity_. 

#### Step 1: Preparing a Translation for December 2025 

 To prepare a translation for the 12-2025 period, do the following: 

1. Open the _Prepare Translation_ (CM501000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Translation ID** : _EUR_     Here you specify the translation definition to be used for the translation. 

- **Fin. Period** : _12-2025_     This is the financial period for which the translation will be performed. 

- **Currency Effective Date** : _12/31/2025_     This is the effective date of the currency exchange rate to be used for the translation. 

- **Description** : _Translation to EUR_ (inserted automatically) The table displays the currency rates that will be used in the translation. These are the rates of different rate types that are effective on the translation date. 

 When you are performing a translation in a production environment, make sure that you have completed the translation for the previous periods. If any periods were skipped, you will see incorrect balances of the accounts that are translated by the PTD Balance method and have nonzero PTD balances for the skipped periods. 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Create Translation**.     The system prepares the translation worksheet and displays it on the _Translation Worksheets_ (CM304000)     form. 

#### Step 2: Reviewing the Balances and Releasing the Translation 

 To review the translated balances and release the translation, do the following: 

1. While you are still on the _Translation Worksheets_ (CM304000) form, review the prepared translation     worksheet.     The system has translated the account balances by using the exchange rates of the appropriate type and the     rules of translation specified in the translation definition. The **Source Amount** column shows the amount     to be translated: the PTD balance for the accounts translated with the _PTD Balance_ method, and the ending     balance for the period for the accounts translated with the _YTD Balance_ method. The **Translated Amount**     column shows the source amount that the system converted by using the specified currency rate as follows: 

- For the accounts translated with the _YTD Balance_ method, this is the account balance at the end of the     period in the reporting ledger. 

- For the accounts translated with the _PTD Balance_ method, this is the account period-to-date balance for     the period in the reporting ledger. The **Transaction Debit Amount** and **Transaction Credit Amount** columns show the amount in which the account will be debited or credited in the translation batch to get the needed balance. This is the first translation that you have performed in the _EUROTRANS_ reporting ledger. (You created this ledger in _Translation Definitions: Implementation Activity_ .) Thus, all the nonzero account balances were processed, and the debit and credit amounts equal the translated amounts. The **Orig. Translated Amount** column shows account balances (PTD balances or ending balances, depending on the selected translation method) in the reporting ledger before the 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 113 

 translation. Currently, the column shows 0.00 for all the accounts, because before the translation, all account balances were equal to zero. The system translates balances of different accounts by using different currency rates (as the translation definition specifies), so the total of the translated assets and expenses does not match the total of the translated liabilities and incomes. To make the Debit Total equal the Credit Total in the translation worksheet, this discrepancy is posted to the Translation Gain/Loss account specified for the reporting currency. This amount is not translated, and thus the Currency Rate for this row is 1.00. The Debit Total and Credit Total equal the Control Total. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Release** to release the translation worksheet.     The system generates a transaction and posts it to the _EUROTRANS_ reporting ledger. 

3. Click the **Translation Batch Number** link in the Summary area. 

4. On the _Journal Transactions_ (GL301000) form, which opens, review the generated transaction.     The amounts from the **Transaction Debit Amount** and **Transaction Credit Amount** columns, which you     have reviewed on the translation worksheet, were copied into the **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount**     columns, respectively. Notice that you can review the batch only in _EUR_ , because it is the currency assigned     to the _EUROTRANS_ reporting ledger. 

 If aer a translation was performed for the period, you have posted some new transactions to the actual ledger in this period, you have to perform the translation one more time; subsequent translations for the same period will adjust the account balance if the account balance has changed. 

 If you have used the wrong currency rate in the translation, change the rate to the correct one and redo the translation. 

 The EUROTRANS reporting ledger now contains account balances translated to EUR , so that you can use it for preparing financial statements and other reports in the EUR currency for the 12-2025 period. 

#### Step 3: Reviewing the Balances of the Reporting Ledger 

 To review the balances of the EUROTRANS reporting ledger, do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted by default) 

- **Ledger** : _EUROTRANS_ 

- **Financial Period** : _12-2025_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Cleared 

3. Review the table.     Account balances have been translated to _EUR_ and recorded to the reporting ledger. The amounts in     the **Ending Balance** column are the same as those in the **Translated Balance** column of the translation     worksheet that you released. 

#### Step 4: Preparing and Releasing a Translation for January 2026 

 To prepare a translation for the 01-2026 period, do the following: 

1. In the info area, set the business date to _1/31/2026_. 

2. Open the _Prepare Translation_ (CM501000) form. 

3. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Translating Financial Statements | 114 

- **Translation ID** : _EUR_ 

- **Fin. Period** : _01-2026_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Currency Effective Date** : _1/31/2026_ (inserted automatically) 

- **Description** : _Translation to EUR_ (inserted automatically) **Last Fin. Period** shows the period for which the most recent translation was performed ( _12-2025_ ). 

 If you have prepared a translation for a period and have not released it, you will not be able to prepare a translation for the next period until you release or delete the prepared translation on the Translation Worksheets (CM304000) form. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Create Translation**.     The system prepares the translation and displays it on the _Translation Worksheets_ form. The system prepares     the translation that adjusts the results of the previous translation. Notice that not all accounts were     processed during this translation: The system processes only accounts with the _PTD Balance_ method that     have transactions in the translation period, and accounts with the _YTD Balance_ method that have nonzero     balances. Because the _SPOT_ rate at the end of _12-2025_ and at the end of _01-2026_ differs, the system also     translates all assets and liabilities.     The **Transaction Debit Amount** and **Transaction Credit Amount** columns display the adjusting amounts     that will be posted to the accounts in the reporting ledger. Thus, the ending balances for the accounts     translated with the _YTD Balance_ method and the PTD balances for accounts translated with the _PTD Balance_     method become equal to the amounts in the **Translated Amount** column. 

5. On the form toolbar, click **Release**. 

6. Open the _Translation Details_ (CM651500) report form. 

7. On the **Report Parameters** tab, specify the following settings: 

- **Financial Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Translation Number** : _000002_ 

8. On the form toolbar, click **Run Report**. 

9. Review the report. It lists the accounts whose balances were updated with the translation. 

#### Step 5: Reviewing the Balances of the Reporting Ledger 

 To review the balances of the reporting ledger updated by the translation, do the following: 

1. Open the _Account Summary_ (GL401000) form. 

2. In the Selection area, specify the following settings: 

- **Company/Branch** : _HEADOFFICE - SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center_ (inserted by default) 

- **Ledger** : _EUROTRANS_ 

- **Period** : _01-2026_ 

- **Show Currency Details** : Cleared 

3. Review the form.     The account balances were updated with the results of the translation in _01-2026_. At the end of the 2025     financial year, the system automatically transferred the net income from the YTD Net Income account to the     Retained Earnings account. Therefore, the beginning balance of the _32000_ (Retained Earnings) account is     €27,682.37, and the balance of the _33000_ (Net Income) account at the start of _01-2026_ is €0.00. The ending     balance of the _33000_ account for the _01-2026_ period was automatically calculated from the balances of the     income and expense accounts, and is now –€37,588.96.

## Preparing a Consolidated Financial Statement 

 The topics of this chapter describe how to prepare consolidated financial data for a parent company and a subsidiary company that use different base currencies. 

### Consolidated Financial Statement: General Information 

 Acumatica ERP provides the Analytical Report Manager (ARM) toolkit, which you can use to build analytical reports that retrieve amounts posted to particular general ledger accounts and subaccounts. You can configure these reports to display data for a company, a company group, or particular branches of a company. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Perform a translation of account balances from the company base currency (CAD) to the base currency of     the parent company (USD) 

- Create and configure a unit set and column set and apply them to an analytical report 

- Run the analytical report to display consolidated financial data for two companies in USD 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create a consolidated financial statement if you need to review the consolidated data of multiple companies that are configured in the same tenant. If these companies have different base currencies, you have to translate them into the same currency first. 

#### Structure of an ARM Report 

 An ARM report typically consists of the following elements: 

- The row set, which defines the rows to be used in the report. 

- The column set, which defines the report title, the column headers, and the columns of the report. 

- Unit sets, which give you the ability to quickly filter or consolidate report data. Unit sets are optional for ARM     reports in general. 

- The report definition, which identifies a particular report. The report definition links the row set, the column     set, and the unit set of the report and defines the report parameters. By using the report definition, you can     easily add the report to the site map. You can use each row set, column set, or unit set in one report definition or in multiple definitions. 

#### Filtering of Data with Unit Sets 

 You can use a unit set to organize the report structure in the following cases: 

- When the groups of rows and columns included in the report use data from different data sources 

- When formulas must be applied to calculate the report values based on the data from the explicitly defined     groups of columns and rows A unit set can include one unit or multiple units that specify how the data is selected, calculated, and displayed in reports. In the report, you can view data for each individual unit, which could be a branch or a cost center, as well as data consolidated for all the units.

 Preparing a Consolidated Financial Statement | 117 

#### Workflow of Preparing a Consolidated Financial Statement 

 When you are preparing a consolidated financial statement of multiple companies using different base currencies, the typical process involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. 

1. You perform the necessary configuration and prepare a _translation definition_ that will be used to translate     the account balances of the company with the _CAD_ base currency in _USD_. The translation definition created     on the _Translation Definition_ (CM203000) form includes the source ledger and destination ledger, the     accounts to be translated, and the rules to be used for translation. 

2. You prepare a translation for a particular financial period on the _Prepare Translation_ (CM501000) form. When     the system prepares the translation by using the specified translation definition, it generates a translation     worksheet and shows it on the _Translation Worksheets_ (CM304000) form. You then review and release the     translation worksheet. 

3. To create a consolidated financial statement based on the _Profit & Loss_ (GL635000) report, you create a row     set and a column set for the new report by copying a row set on the _Row Sets_ (CS206010) form and a column     set on the _Column Sets_ (CS206020) form. 

4. On the _Report Definitions_ (CS206000) form, you create a report definition by copying the report definition of     the _Profit & Loss_ report, and select the newly created row set and column set for the report definition. 

5. On the _Unit Sets_ (CS206030) form, you create a unit set for the new report, where you specify the nodes to be     shown in the report and the formula for calculating the consolidated financial data for the entire SweetLife     company. 

6. On the _Report Definitions_ form, you apply the new unit set to the report definition you created. 

### Consolidated Financial Statement: Implementation Checklist 

 The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for preparing a consolidated financial statement, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. 

#### Implementation Checklist 

 We recommend that before you initially perform translation of financial statements and then preparation of a consolidated financial statement, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Make sure that the Standard Financials , Multibranch Support , Multicompany Support , Customer and Vendor Visibility Restriction , Multicurrency Accounting , Multiple Base Currencies , and Translation of Financial Statements features have been enabled. 

 For details on configuring multiple base currencies, see Multiple Base Currencies: Implementation Activity , Customer Visibility: To Restrict Visibility to a New Company , and Vendor Visibility: To Restrict Visibility to a New Company. 

 Chart of Accounts (GL202500) Make sure that the accounts that will be used for recording translation gains and losses have been created. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Preparing a Consolidated Financial Statement | 118 

 Form Criteria to Check 

 Company Financial Calendar (GL201100) Make sure that the financial period for which you want to configure a translation definition has the Open status. 

 Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) 

 Make sure that the accounts for recording translation gains and losses have been specified. 

 Currencies (CM202000) Make sure that the translation gain and loss accounts have been specified for each base currency. 

 Currency Rate Types (CM201000) Make sure that the rate types used for translations have been defined. 

 Currency Rates (CM201000) Make sure that the effective exchange rates to be used for translations have been defined. 

 Ledgers (GL201500) You create a ledger of the Reporting type to be used for keeping the results of translations. For details on reporting ledgers, see Reporting Ledgers. 

 Translation Definition (CM203000) You create a translation definition that will be used for translating financial statements. 

#### Other Settings That Affect the Workflow 

 You can affect the workflow of translating financial statements by specifying additional settings as follows: 

- To cause translation batches to be automatically posted to the general ledger, on the _Currency Management_     _Preferences_ (CM101000) form, select the **Automatically Post to GL on Release** check box. 

#### Validation of Configuration 

 To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you perform a translation of financial statements as described in Consolidated Financial Statement: Performing a Translation and prepare a consolidated financial statement as described in Consolidated Financial Statement: Creating a Customized Report. 

### Consolidated Financial Statement: Performing a Translation 

 The following activity will walk you through the process of creating a translation definition and performing the translation of the balances of SweetLife Canada in the US dollars. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that at the end of January 2026, the managers of SweetLife Fruits & Jams need to review the consolidated financial statement of SweetLife (the parent company) and SweetLife Canada (a subsidiary in Canada). Because the companies use different base currencies—the US dollars for SweetLife and Canadian dollars for SweetLife Canada —the account balances of SweetLife Canada need to be translated into USD first. 

 Further suppose that SweetLife's chief accountant has decided that balances have to be translated based on the following rules: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Preparing a Consolidated Financial Statement | 119 

- Assets and liabilities should be translated by using the current exchange rate. 

- The Capital account should be translated by using the historical exchange rate. 

- The Retained Earnings account should be translated by using the current exchange rate. 

- Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses should be translated by using the average exchange rate for the     period that is used for translation. Acting as Kimberly Gibbs, an employee who has access to both companies, you need to upload transactions for the 01-2026 period and translate the account balances of SweetLife Canada for January 2026 into USD (the base currency of SweetLife Fruits & Jams). 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the _Multibranch Support_ , _Multicompany Support_ , _Customer_     _and Vendor Visibility Restriction_ , _Multicurrency Accounting_ , and _Multiple Base Currencies_ features have been     enabled. 

- On the _Companies_ (CS101500) form, the _MUFFINS_ company has been configured. 

- On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, the _MHEAD_ branch of the _MUFFINS_ company has been created. 

- On the _Chart of Accounts_ (GL202500) form, the following accounts have been created: 

- _10100 - SweetStore Cash Register_ 

- _28000 - AP Retainage_ 

- _30000 - Opening Bal Equity_ 

- _32000 - Retained Earnings_ 

- _40000 - Sales Revenue_ 

- _90000 - Gain / Loss of Fixed Asset_ 

- On the _Currency Rate Types_ (CM201000) form, the _SPOT_ type has been created. 

#### Process Overview 

 In this activity, you will first enable the Translation of Financial Statements feature on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. On the Currencies (CM202000) form, you will specify the GL accounts for the CAD and USD currencies.

### Reports 

 In addition to offering a comprehensive collection of reports, Acumatica ERP gives you a high degree of control over each report. 

 On a typical report form, described in Report Form , you can adjust the report settings to meet your specific informational needs. You can specify sorting and filtering options and select the data by using report-specific settings—such as financial period, ledger, and account—and configure additional processing settings for each report. The settings can be saved as a report template for later use. For details, see To Run a Report and To Create a Report Template. 

 Aer you run a report, the prepared report appears on your screen. You can print the report, export the report to a file, or send the report by email. 

 This chapter describes a typical report form and the main tasks related to using reports.

### Form Toolbar and More Menu 

 The form toolbar, which is available on most forms, is located near the top of the form, under the form name (and record title, if the form has one), as shown in the following screenshot. 

 The form toolbar includes the following: 

- Standard buttons (see Item 1 in the following screenshot), with the particular set of buttons depending on     the specific form 

- On some forms, form-specific buttons (Item 2) 

- On some form, the More button (Item 3); clicking this button opens the More menu (Item 4), which contains     additional form-specific commands 

 Figure: The form toolbar and the More menu 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 138 

 You use the standard buttons on the form toolbar to navigate through entities that were created by using the current form, insert or delete an entity, use the clipboard, save the data you have entered, or cancel your work on the form. 

 A form toolbar on a particular form may include form-specific buttons in addition to standard buttons; it may also (or instead) include commands on the More menu. By using these form-specific buttons and commands, users can navigate to related records and forms, initiate specific actions, and perform modifications or processing related to the functionality of the form. 

#### Standard Form Toolbar Buttons 

 The following table lists the standard buttons of the form toolbar. A form toolbar may include some or all of these buttons. 

 Table: Standard Form Toolbar Buttons 

 Button Icon Description 

 Discard Changes and Close

 If the system opened the current form in a pop-up window (from a different form), this button is not displayed. To return to the original form, click Close. 

 Save & Close Saves the changes made to the entity, and navigates to the list of records that is related to the current form. 

 Save Saves the changes made to the entity. 

 Cancel Depending on the context, does one of the following: 

- Discards any unsaved changes you have made to entities and retrieves the     last saved version. 

- Clears all changes and restores the default settings. 

 Add New Record Clears any values you've specified on the form, restores any default values, and initiates the creation of a new entity. 

 Delete Deletes the currently selected entity, clears any values you have specified on the form, and populates elements with the default values that the system inserts when a new entity is created. 

 You can delete an entity only if it is not linked with another entity. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 139 

 Button Icon Description 

 Archive Archives the document that is opened on the form. This button is available if archival is set up on the Archival Policy (SM200400) form for the type of the document open on the form and if the document meets the archival criteria—that is, if the document is older than the retention period specified on the Archival Policy form and has been processed to completion or canceled. 

 For more information on archiving the documents, see Archiving Old Documents in the Acumatica ERP System Administration guide. 

 Extract Extracts the archived document from the archive and makes the system use this document in day-to-day operations. This button is available if archival is set up on the Archival Policy (SM200400) form for the type of the document opened on the form is archived. 

 For more information on archiving the documents, see Archiving Old Documents in the Acumatica ERP System Administration guide.

 View Schedule Gives you the ability to schedule the processing. For more information, see Automated Processing: General Information. 

#### Inquiry Form Toolbar Buttons 

 Acumatica ERP inquiry forms present data in a tabular format; they may also have selection criteria you can use to filter the data in the table. Predefined inquiry forms are provided as part of Acumatica ERP out of the box, and 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 140 

 inquiry forms can be designed by a user with the appropriate access rights by using the Generic Inquiry tool (for details, see Managing Generic Inquiries in the Acumatica ERP Reporting Tools Guide). A form toolbar of an inquiry form contains both the standard form toolbar buttons (described in the table above) and the additional buttons described below. 

 Button Icon Description 

 Refresh Refreshes the inquiry data in the table. 

 Cancel Clears all changes (including selection criteria that has been specified, if the generic inquiry form has this criteria) and restores the default settings. 

 Add New Record Initiates the creation of a new entity. 

 Edit Opens the applicable data entry form with the selected record. 

 Fit to Screen Expands the form to fit on the screen and adjusts the column widths proportionally. 

 Export to Excel Exports the data to an Excel file. For more information, see Integration with Excel in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. 

#### The More Menu and Form-Specific Buttons 

 If there are multiple form-specific commands on the form toolbar, they are displayed on a single menu—the More menu—and listed under descriptive categories, which makes it easier to find the needed menu command. On the More menu, you can easily define your favorite menu commands, which eases access to them. 

 On some forms, the system places a button (which is highlighted in green) on the form toolbar for the expected next command, which represents the likely next step to be performed on the selected record. The following screenshot, which shows the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form, illustrates an example of the form toolbar and the More menu, which contains categories and menu commands. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 141 

 Figure: The form toolbar of the Transactions form 

 The numbered items in the screenshot indicate the following: 

1. A highlighted button for the expected next command, which represents the next logical step to be     performed on the record selected on the form 

2. Another button for a command that is commonly performed on the form 

3. The More button, which you click to open the More menu 

4. The More menu with most form-specific menu commands and descriptive categories on it 

5. The star icon, which is used to mark the individual user's favorite commands on the form 

6. An unavailable command 

#### Favorite Commands 

 Based on your role in the company and your job duties, you may use some commands more oen than others. On the form toolbar, you can specify these commands as favorites. This will cause the system to duplicate the commands as form toolbar buttons, easing access to them. 

 To add a command to the form toolbar as a button, you open the More menu, hover over the needed command, and click the star icon when it appears. The yellow color of the star indicates that the command has been added to your favorites, and a button for the command appears on the form toolbar immediately. The following example shows two commands that have been added to the user's favorites on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form and thus added as buttons on the form toolbar. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 142 

 Figure: Favorite commands on the More menu and the corresponding toolbar buttons 

 Favorites are individual to each user account, specific to a particular form, and preserved across user sessions. 

#### Highlighted Buttons and Commands 

 On some forms, the system applies predefined logic to commands for specific records. Based on this logic, the system may place a button on the form toolbar, highlight it using some color, or do both of these things. 

 If a command is the expected next command (that is, the command that is most likely to be clicked for a record with the current status), it is shown both on the form toolbar and on the More menu. The primary command on the form toolbar is highlighted in green (see Item 1 in the following screenshot), and on the More menu, it is marked with a green dot (Item 2). Below is an example of a cash transaction on the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form that has the On Hold status (Item 3). Before you can process it, you need to remove it from hold. Because Remove Hold is the next logical command, it is displayed as a button on the form toolbar and highlighted in green. 

 Figure: The highlighted command and the corresponding status 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 143 

#### Unavailable Commands on the More Menu 

 By default, on the More menu, the system displays all commands that could be available for the form, based on the system configuration. Some of these commands may be unavailable (that is, they are listed but cannot be clicked). These are the commands that are not applicable to the record based on its current status or other factors. 

#### The Responsive Form Toolbar and More Menu 

 The form toolbar and the More menu have a responsive layout, meaning that they dynamically adjust to different screen sizes. When there is enough space, buttons for highlighted and favorite commands are displayed on the form toolbar. When the screen size decreases, the system moves the commands off the form toolbar one by one but keeps them on the More menu. 

 If there are multiple categories on the More menu, the categories and menu commands can be displayed in multiple columns on the More menu, depending on the screen size and the number of categories. When the screen size decreases, the system moves some categories and menu commands to the le to decrease the number of columns, and in the screens of the smallest size, all categories are displayed in one column. Below are two examples of the same menu in different screen sizes for a record on the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form.
