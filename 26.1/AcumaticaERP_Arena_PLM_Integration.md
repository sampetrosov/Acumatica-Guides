## Integrating Acumatica ERP with Arena Solutions: General 

## Information 

 Companies that manufacture complex products or are in regulated industries (such as medicine) need to capture requirements, track compliance, and control changes. To address these challenges, many of these organizations implement product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, such as Arena Solutions. The Acumatica ERP native connector for Arena Solutions streamlines the data synchronization between Arena Solutions and Acumatica ERP. 

 In this topic, you will find general information about the integration between Arena Solutions and Acumatica ERP. 

#### Product Lifecycle Management Systems 

 Organizations that use product lifecycle management systems, such as Arena Solutions, usually have engineers who design new products and work with product management and marketing to bring the products to market. Requirements, restrictions (such as environment and regulatory compliance), and decisions must be captured and made available to the engineer as the part of the design process. The engineer needs a PLM system to collaborate, as well as to manage projects. Once a new product is finalized, the PLM system can provide a streamlined mechanism to push revisions to the ERP system in which production orders will be created for product manufacturing. The set of product requirements and components managed by using a PLM system is called the engineering bill of material ( EBOM ). 

 PLM systems are typically deployed by companies in the following industries: 

- Aerospace and defense 

- Automotive and other transport 

- Electronics and high-tech (high-tech consumer devices, semiconductors, telephony and satellites, and     medical devices) 

- Fabrication and assembly 

- Process and consumables (pharmaceutical and food and beverage) 

- Construction and shipbuilding) 

- Utilities 

#### Engineering Change Control 

 Both Acumatica ERP Manufacturing Edition and Arena Solutions support controlling changes in products. The engineering change control functionality in Acumatica ERP Manufacturing Edition provides the ability to manage changes in bills of material and supports approvals of changes. Arena Solutions provides the additional features listed in the following table. 

 You can use either Acumatica ERP Manufacturing Edition or Arena Solutions for the engineering change control functionality. If on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the Arena PLM Integration feature is enabled, you cannot enable the Engineering Change Control feature.

## Initial Configuration of Acumatica ERP and Arena 

## Solutions 

 When you integrate Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions, you first need to prepare both systems properly and perform an initial sync of the data. In this chapter, you will find details about the initial configuration of Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions and the initial data synchronization. 

### Initial Configuration: General Information 

 When you initially configure integration between Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions, you need to set up an Arena Solutions workspace, establish a connection between the Acumatica ERP instance and Arena Solutions, and perform the initial data synchronization. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Prepare an Arena Solutions tenant for integration 

- Prepare an Acumatica ERP instance for integration 

- Perform initial data synchronization between the systems 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You implement the integration of Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions when your organization uses both systems and would like to manage product lifecycles in Arena Solutions and use Acumatica ERP for managing financial information related to manufacturing. 

#### General Steps for Establishing the Connection and Performing the Initial Configuration 

 In order to connect the Acumatica ERP instance to Arena Solutions, you perform the following general steps: 

1. You prepare an Arena Solutions tenant. 

2. You prepare an Acumatica ERP instance. 

3. You perform the initial synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions. 

 Each of these general steps is described in more detail in the following sections. 

#### Arena Solutions Preparation 

 You should make sure that the following actions have been done in Arena Solutions before you set up integration with Acumatica ERP: 

1. If you do not have access to Arena Solutions, you request a demo instance. 

2. Sign in to Arena Solutions, you open the workspace and copy the workspace ID in the URL of your instance.     You will need the ID later when setting up connection in Acumatica ERP. 

3. You do the following in the Arena Solutions workspace:     a. You specify workspace settings in the **Summary > Settings** view.     b. You create users in the **Users > Access** view. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Initial Configuration of Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions | 8 

 c. You specify the needed item settings in the Items view. d. You define item attributes in the Attributes > Items view. 

 These attributes will not be created automatically in Acumatica ERP during data synchronization, so you need to create attributes in both Arena Solutions and in Acumatica ERP. Attribute names must match in both systems. 

 e. You define the item categories and default attributes in the Categories > Items view. f. Optional: You define units of measure for items in the Lists > Units of Measure section. 

 If the units of measure were defined in Arena Solutions before you have up integration with Acumatica ERP, you need to create a substitution list on the Substitution Lists (SM206026) form to map the units of measure in Arena Solutions to those in Acumatica ERP. If the units of measure were not specified in Arena Solutions, you create them in Arena Solutions with the same names they have as in Acumatica ERP. In this case, you do not need to create a substitution list. 

 g. Make sure that the items and the engineering bills of material to be imported have been created. 

#### Acumatica ERP Preparation 

 To prepare an Acumatica ERP instance for integration with Arena Solutions, you need to do the following: 

1. You install Acumatica ERP 2026 R1. 

2. You download the customization package that provides integration from _Acumatica Community_. 

3. You import and publish the customization package. 

4. On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, you do the following: 

- Enable the _Arena PLM Integration_ feature. 

- Make sure that the _Manufacturing_ and _Retail Commerce_ features are enabled. 

- Make sure that the _Engineering Change Control_ feature is disabled. 

 You can review the feature states aer you publish the customization package. 

5. Optional: On the _Substitution Lists_ (SM206026) form, you create a substitution list for units of measure. 

 You need to create the substitution list for units of measure only if the units of measure were defined in Arena Solutions before you have set up integration with Acumatica ERP and their names differ from those defined in Acumatica ERP. 

6. On the _Arena Integration_ (BCAR2010) form, you establish the connection between the systems, activate the     entities to be synchronized, and specify synchronization settings. 

7. On the _Entities_ (BC202000) form, you specify filters for entities, such as vendors, stock items, and bills of     material. (Filters are conditions according to which the system will include entities in synchronization or     exclude them from synchronization.) 

 We recommend that you add the following filters: 

- For categories to be imported; this filter prevents the import of inactive categories 

- For vendors; this filter limits the vendors exported to Arena Solutions 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Initial Configuration of Acumatica ERP and Arena Solutions | 9 

8. If any items or bills of material have attributes assigned (such as color or size), on the _Attributes_ (CS205000)     form, you create the attributes to be used for stock items and bills of material. 

 The attribute description in Acumatica ERP must match the attribute label in Arena Solutions. 

 You can find the detailed instructions for setting up the Acumatica ERP instance in Initial Configuration: To Set Up Acumatica ERP. 

#### Initial Data Synchronization 

 During the initial data synchronization of the systems, you do the following: 

1. You sync sales categories to import the categories from Arena Solutions to Acumatica ERP. 

2. You sync vendors to export vendors from Acumatica ERP to Arena Solutions. 

3. You sync stock items, bills of material, and vendor details to import the data from Arena Solutions to     Acumatica ERP. 

 For detailed instructions, see Initial Configuration: To Initially Sync Data. 

### Initial Configuration: To Set Up Acumatica ERP 

 In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to prepare an Acumatica ERP instance for integration with Arena Solutions. You can use any tenant of Acumatica ERP with manufacturing functionality configured, or you can install the SalesDemo dataset, in which manufacturing functionality is preconfigured. 

 Before you start setting up an Acumatica ERP instance, you should obtain access to Arena Solutions, copy the workspace ID, and configure all required entities that will be synced. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that you are an implementation consultant who needs to prepare an Acumatica ERP instance for integration with Arena Solutions. You will establish the connection between the systems, specify integration settings, and specify filters for the entities that will be synced between the systems—in this example, vendors, stock items, and bills of material (BOMs). 

 Suppose that based on the business processes of your organization, you need to configure Acumatica ERP so that it does the following: 

- Creates sales categories that exist in Arena Solutions but are absent in Acumatica ERP 

- If a supplier (vendor) in Arena Solutions specified in the settings of an item does not exist in Acumatica ERP,     uses a specific default vendor 

- Automatically creates a stock item for a new item revision in Arena Solutions 

- Copies operations and materials from the previous revision of a bill of material to a new revision 

- Copies materials from an engineering BOM (added in Arena Solutions) to a BOM in Acumatica ERP 

- Assigns the _Inactive_ status to items that are marked as deprecated or obsolete in Arena Solutions You will also specify the default operation number and work center for new bills of material that are created in Acumatica ERP during data synchronization. 

 Also, suppose that you need to include in data synchronization only vendors assigned to a particular vendor class and stock items with an effective date starting from a particular date; you also need to exclude a particular bill of material from data synchronization.

 In this chapter, you will find information about the synchronization of item data. 

### Item Import: General Information 

 If you have integrated Acumatica ERP with Arena Solutions, you manage items in Arena Solutions. To make the changes available in Acumatica ERP, you need to import the items, as described in this topic. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this topic, you will learn how to import items into Acumatica ERP that have been created or changed in Arena Solutions. 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You import items into Acumatica ERP in the following cases: 

- When you have created any items in Arena Solutions and would like to process manufacturing documents     containing the items in Acumatica ERP 

- When you have changed item settings in Arena Solutions and would like to make these changes available in     Acumatica ERP 

#### Creation of an Item in Arena Solutions 

 When you create an item in Arena Solutions, you need to do the following to make the item ready to be imported into Acumatica ERP: 

1. You create the item. 

2. You create an engineering bill of material for the item. 

3. You release the item to design. 

4. You release the item to production. 

 You can import into Acumatica ERP only items that have been released to production in Arena Solutions. 

#### Item Import 

 In Acumatica ERP, you do the following to import new items and changes in the existing items from Arena Solutions: 

1. On the _Prepare Data_ (BC501000) form, you prepare the _Stock Item_ and _Bill of Material_ entities for import. 

 We recommend that you select the Incremental prepare mode so that the systems syncs only entities with changed data. This will decrease the synchronization time. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Importing Items | 17 

2. On the _Process Data_ (BC501500) form, you import the prepared records. 

- If any filters have been created for the entities on the _Entities_ (BC202000) form, the system     will process the entities according the filter conditions. 

- If any records are processed unsuccessfully, the system marks these entities as failed. You     can investigate these records and reprocess them later. 

3. Optional: On the _Sync History_ (BC301000) form, you view the imported records. 

4. On the _Stock Items_ (IN202500) form, you open each of the imported or changed stock items and specify     additional settings, if needed. 

5. On the _Bill of Material_ (AM208000) form, you open each of the imported bills of material and reconcile them,     as described in _Import of Bills of Material: General Information_. 

### Item Import: Synchronization Details 

 You create and manage the stock items used in manufacturing (finished goods and components) in Arena Solutions, and then you import the items into Acumatica ERP during data synchronization. In this topic, you will find information about the synchronization of item records between Arena Solutions and Acumatica ERP. 

#### Item Revisions in Arena Solutions 

 Arena Solutions supports item revisions; that is, if the item settings have to be changed significantly, an engineer can create a new item revision. Because item revisions are not supported in Acumatica ERP, the identifier of the item revision imported from Arena Solutions is displayed in the PLM Revision ID box on the Manufacturing tab of the Stock Items (IN202500) form and is unavailable for editing. 

 When you are importing item data from Arena Solutions, for a new item revision, the system either creates a new item to represent the revision or updates the settings of the existing item being revised, depending on the state of the Create Item for New Revision check box on the Other tab of the Arena Integration (BCAR2010) form. 

 If you want each item revision to be managed separately in Acumatica ERP, you should select the Create Item for New Revision check box so that the system creates an item for each revision. 

#### Item Synchronization 

 Only items that are in production in Arena Solutions can be imported into Acumatica ERP. When you start importing item data by using the Process Data (BC501500) form, the system syncs the data as follows: 

- If an item does not exist in Acumatica ERP, the system will create the item on the _Stock Items_ (IN202500)     form. 

- If the shared settings of the current item revision have been changed in Arena Solutions, the system updates     the changed item settings. 

- If a new item revision has been added in Arena Solutions, the system behaves as follows, depending on the     state of the **Create Item for New Revision** check box on the **Other** tab of the _Arena Integration_ (BCAR2010)     form: 

- If the check box is selected, the system creates a stock item for the new revision. The system will append     the revision number to the inventory ID of the item to make it unique by using the character specified in     the **Delimiter** box on the _Arena Integration_ form. 

- If the check box is cleared, the system will update the shared settings of the existing item. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Importing Items | 18 

- If the status of the item has been changed to _Obsolete_ in Arena Solutions since the last sync, the system will     change the status of the stock item in Acumatica ERP to the value specified in the **Status of Obsolete Item**     box of the **Other** tab on the _Arena Integration_ form. 

- If the status of the item has been changed to _Deprecated_ in Arena Solutions since the last sync, the system     will change the status of the stock item to the value specified in the **Status of Deprecated Item** box of the     **Other** tab on the _Arena Integration_ form. 

#### Item Mapping 

 The following table shows the mapping of Acumatica ERP elements to Arena Solutions elements that is used during the import of item data from Arena Solutions. In Arena Solutions, you can find item settings in the Item world. In Acumatica ERP, you can find the item settings on the Stock Items (IN202500) form.

<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Importing Bills of Material | 20 

 You must specify the default work center if either (or both) of the Copy Data of Latest BOM Revision to New BOM Revision or Create Operation and Copy EBOM Materials check boxes are selected. 

#### Creation of an EBOM Revision in Arena Solutions 

 When you create an engineering bill of material in Arena Solutions, you do the following to make it available to be imported into Acumatica ERP: 

1. You create the EBOM (technically, you create the first revision of the EBOM). 

2. You add all needed components to the EBOM. 

3. You make the revision of the EBOM effective. 

 When you have made changes to an existing EBOM, you make the revision a working revision, make the required changes, and make the revision effective. 

#### Import of Engineering Bills of Material 

 You import new and changed engineering bills of material into Acumatica ERP as follows: 

1. On the _Prepare Data_ (BC501000) form, you prepare the _Bill of Material_ entity for import. 

 We recommend that you select the Incremental prepare mode so that the systems syncs only entities with changed data. This will decrease the synchronization time. 

2. On the _Process Data_ (BC501500) form, you import the prepared records. 

- If any filters have been created for the entities on the _Entities_ (BC202000) form, the system     will process the entities according the filter conditions. 

- If any records are processed unsuccessfully, the system marks these entities as failed. You     can investigate these records and reprocess them later. 

3. Optional: On the _Sync History_ (BC301000) form, you view the imported records. 

 Then you need to reconcile the imported bills of material. 

#### Reconciliation of Bills of Material 

 When you have imported the bills of material, you need to reconcile them on the Bill of Material (AM208000) form as follows: 

1. On the **Engineering BOM** tab, you view the list of materials in the engineering BOM. The **Unreconciled Qty.**     column shows the quantity of the material that you must add to a BOM operation. 

2. On the **Operations** tab, make sure that all necessary operations are displayed. If not, you can do any of the     following: 

- If this is a new bill of material, you click **Copy from EBOM** on the table toolbar to make the system     add the operation specified in the **BOM Operation ID** box on the **Other** tab of the _Arena Integration_     (BCAR2010) form and copy materials from the engineering BOM to the list of materials for this operation. 

- If this is a new revision of an existing bill of material, you click **Create from Last Revision** on the form     toolbar to make the system copy operations and materials from the previous BOM revision.
