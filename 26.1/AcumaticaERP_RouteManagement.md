 Overview of Route Management Processes | 5 

## Overview of Route Management Processes 

 You use the route management functionality to plan and manage your organization's routes and the route services (that is, the services provided when each route is executed), along with processing the contracts related to the routes. In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. Each stop in the route execution is a route appointment—that is, an appointment with a service order type of the Route behavior. Each route execution is based on a particular route and inherits some of its settings. 

 You can track your executed routes by using the Azure Maps service and get the statistics on each execution of a route, such as the distance and the time needed to execute the route. With the integration between the route management and the service management of Acumatica ERP, you can create appointments related to route executions and generate invoices for services that have been provided. 

 You use the route management forms to perform a variety of procedures related to processing routes and related documents and entities. These procedures are briefly described in the following sections of this topic. 

#### Route Management Documents 

 Each route execution created through the route management functionality includes appointments linked to service orders. Once the appointments and route execution are completed or closed, you can generate the appropriate billing documents. 

 In addition to billing documents, you can generate inventory documents, such as issues and receipts (the Inventory Management feature should be additionally enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form). 

 These documents are further processed, and the corresponding financial transactions are posted to the General Ledger. 

#### Managing Staff Members (Drivers) 

 The integration of route management with service management allows you to define drivers in the system, enabling you to track and assign them to routes. A driver is a staff member who can perform services associated with routes. With this integration, you can quickly and easily select the most suitable available person to deliver your services. 

#### Managing Vehicles 

 You can enter and store detailed information about each company vehicle. Since route management is integrated with equipment management, each vehicle can also be tracked within the equipment management system. Using route management, you can efficiently select a vehicle from the available options to execute a specific route. 

#### Managing and Processing Routes 

 Acumatica ERP offers tools to quickly create and process routes while optimizing them to reduce fuel consumption and travel time. With the Azure Maps service integrated into route management, the system calculates the distances and travel times for executed routes. If you rearrange the order of appointments within a route, Azure Maps automatically replots and recalculates the route. Additionally, you can use the Azure Maps service to easily track executed routes, their appointments, and the staff members assigned to them for specific days. 

#### Processing Route Service Contracts 

 Route service contracts simplify the processing of recurring customer appointments that require route planning. You can define schedules for performing services, and the system will use these schedules to create routes with appointments automatically assigned to them. This functionality saves time and reduces errors by streamlining the process of entering required routes into the system.

 Managing Routes | 6 

## Managing Routes 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain all the necessary information about the routes that your company executes and each specific route execution. The route contains common information for route executions performed by your company—that is, the starting and ending locations of the route, the schedule when it can be performed, and the employees (drivers) who can be assigned to execute the route. 

### Routes: General Information 

 The route stores common information for route executions, including the starting and ending locations, schedule, and involved staff members. You can enter specific details for each route execution, such as start and end locations, times, appointments to be attended, and the assigned driver and vehicle. With this information in the system, you can efficiently process service orders that require route planning. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to create routes. 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create routes in Acumatica ERP when you need to define common settings for multiple route executions within your company. By creating these routes, they serve as templates, ensuring that each execution on a specific day, with a designated driver, vehicle, and appointments, follows the predefined settings. 

### Routes: Entry of a Route 

 In this topic, you will read about entering a route into the system and specifying appropriate settings for the route. 

#### Entering a Route 

 You enter a route on the Routes (FS203700) form. For the route, you specify an identifier and a description, along with the following information: 

- The starting and ending locations of the route 

- The schedule when the route can be executed 

- The drivers who can execute this route and their priority 

- Optionally, the attributes of the route Aer you have created a route in the system, when you create route executions or schedules for the route service contracts and select the route, the system fills in appropriate settings. You can edit routes at any time; the edits will not affect route executions that have already been created based on the route. 

#### Specifying the Start and End Points of the Route 

 The start location of the route is a branch location form where a driver departs to execute a route. You specify the branch and its location in the Branch and Branch Location boxes of the Start Location section on the Routes (FS203700) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Routes | 7 

 The ending location of the route is a branch location to where a driver arrives when he or she finishes to execute a route. You specify the branch and its location in the Branch and Branch Location boxes of the End Location section on the Routes form. 

 Make sure that the addresses have been specified correctly for the branch locations. Otherwise, the system will not be able to calculate the route statistics and show the route on a map. 

 For each route execution created in the system, the start and end locations are defined by the route specified for the route execution. You cannot change the locations for a particular route. 

#### Specifying a Schedule 

 For the route, you specify the possible schedule when the executions of this route can be performed on the Execution Days tab of the Routes (FS203700) form. You define a schedule as follows: 

1. You specify the days of week when this route can be executed by selecting the appropriate check boxes. 

2. For each selected day of week, you specify the time when executions of the route can be started in the **Start**     **Time** column. 

3. You specify the number of executions of this route that can be created per day in the **Nbr. Trip(s) per Day**     column. 

 Route executions do not necessarily have to be generated or created for all the days specified for the route. But the route executions can be created for only the days specified for the route associated with the route execution. 

#### Adding Drivers to a Route 

 In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. 

 For each route that you define in the system, you should include the drivers that can possibly execute this route. These drivers will be available for selection when you assign a driver to a route execution on a particular day. 

 When you define each route in the system on the Routes (FS203700) form, you add possible drivers to the particular route on the Route Employees. For each driver you want to add, you click Add Row on the table toolbar and select a driver in the Employee ID column. 

 In the Priority Preference column, you can also specify the priority with which each assigned driver should be selected to perform services for the route. For example, if one driver has performed the services of this route and knows it well, he or she might have higher priority than a driver who is new and is not familiar with the route or who has served a different geographical area. 

 The lower the digit you specify in this column, the higher the priority for a driver to be selected for a route service. When you later select drivers for a particular execution of this route, the drivers are listed according to the priority specified for them for this route. If the drivers have the same priority, they are listed according their reference number in the system. 

 If you do not assign any drivers to a route, you will not be able to select a driver when you create a route execution based on this route. 

#### Specifying Attributes for Routes 

 An attribute is a site-defined property (for instance, area or problem type) that gives users the ability to specify information for objects in the system beyond the preconfigured settings on the data entry forms. You can specify 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Routes | 8 

 attributes for the classification of route executions by defining them for a particular route on the Attributes tab of the Routes (FS203700) form. 

 On this tab, you can select attributes only if they have already been defined in the system. If you need an attribute that has not been defined in the system, you can use the Attributes (CS205000) form to create the attribute. Then you will be able to select the new attribute for any route. 

 The active attributes you specify on this tab will be listed for executions of this route on the Attributes tab of the Route Document Details (FS304000) form. 

 On the Routes (FS203700) form, you can specify whether each attribute of the route is required. When creating a route execution, the user must specify values for all the required attributes. Also, you can specify default values for any attributes of the route; users can overwrite these values for a particular route execution. 

 You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for executions of a particular route by clearing the Active check box. If you do, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for the executions of the route, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing route executions will still be stored in the database. If you reactivate the attribute, its values (where specified) will become visible in the system again. 

 However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the Delete Row button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the route and all attribute values will bedeleted from the database. 

### Routes: To Create Routes 

 In Acumatica ERP, a route contains common settings for multiple route executions performed by your company. These settings include the starting and ending locations of the route, the schedule when it can be performed, and the employees (drivers) who can be assigned to execute the route. Each route execution is tied to a particular day, a particular driver, a specific vehicle, and particular appointments and services. The route, conversely, is a template with only the settings that will be common to all executions of a route. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that the SweetLife Service and Equipment Sales Center plans to provide services on two routes, each of which has its own schedule. Acting as an administrative user, you will create two routes. The first route ( ROUTE ) can be executed on any working day by either of two drivers in your company. The second route ( TU-ROUTE ) can be executed only on Tuesdays, starting no earlier than 01:00 PM. 

#### Process Overview 

 On the Routes (FS203700) form, you will create two routes with distinct settings. 

#### System Preparation 

 Before you start creating routes, do the following: 

1. On the Acumatica ERP website, sign in to a company with the _U100_ dataset preloaded as a system     administrator by using the _gibbs_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, select the     _SWEETEQUIP - Service and Equipment Sales Center_ branch. 

#### Step: Creating Two Routes 

 Perform the following instructions: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Routes | 9 

1. On the Company and Branch Selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, ensure that the     _SWEETEQUIP - Service and Equipment Sales Center_ branch is selected. 

2. On the _Routes_ (FS203700) form, create a new route and specify the following settings: 

- **Route ID** : R-ROUTE 

- **Description** : Regular route 

3. Under **Start Location** , in the **Branch Location** box, select _WEST BRIGHTON_. 

4. Under **End Location** , in the **Branch Location** box, select _WEST BRIGHTON_. 

5. On the **Execution** tab, select the **Monday** , **Tuesday** , **Wednesday** , **Thursday** , and **Friday** check boxes, and     leave the other check boxes cleared, as shown in the following screenshot. 

6. In the **Start Time** column for all the selected days of the week, select _9:00 AM_ , which is also shown in the     following screenshot. 

 Figure: Creation of the route 

7. On the **Employees** tab, add two rows with the following employees selected in the **Employee ID** column: 

- _EP00000005 (Peter Lai)_ 

- _EP00000045 (Luke Cole)_ Notice that only the staff members with the _Driver_ skill can be selected on this tab. Also notice that the priority of each of the employees is _1_. 

8. In the **Priority Preference** column, change the priority of Luke Cole to 2. 

9. Save your changes. 

10.On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** and specify the following settings for the second route: 

- **Route ID** : TU-ROUTE 

- **Description** : Tuesday route 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Routes | 10 

 11.Under Start Location , in the Branch Location box, select WEST BRIGHTON. 12.Under End Location , in the Branch Location box, select WEST BRIGHTON. 13.On the Execution tab, select the Tuesday check box and leave the other check boxes cleared. 14.In the Start Time box of the selected day of week, select 1:00 PM. 15.On the Employees tab, add two rows with the following settings in the Employee ID column: 

- _EP00000005 (Peter Lai)_ 

- _EP00000045 (Luke Cole)_ 16.Save your changes. 

 You have created two routes in the system. Now you can create route executions and select these routes, and the system will fill in the appropriate settings. 

### Routes: Sequence Definition 

 The appointments for different contracts with the same route are generated automatically in one route execution for a specific date. Thus, you may need to define the order of appointments for each route execution. 

 In this topic, you will read about how to define a route sequence in the system and how to reset the route order numbers of a sequence. 

#### Route Sequence Definition 

 When you create a schedule on the Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form, the system assigns the order number to the schedule in the Order box of the Routes tab. You can change the order number as follows: 

- You can change the number that defines the order of appointments of a particular route service contract in     the **Order** box on the **Routes** tab of the _Route Service Contract Schedules_ form. 

- You can define the sequence in which appointments are generated in a route execution on the _Route_     _Sequences_ (FS303800) form, which displays the appointments and includes the **Order** column. The number that defines the order of the appointment (that is, the **Order** value) can contain up to five digits. To define the sequence, the system uses numbers that go up in increments of 10, such as 00010, 00020, 00030, and so on. You can change the order values to change the order of the appointments. You can use any number, such as 00008 or 00012. Aer you change the order number, the system changes the order of the appointments as follows: The appointment for a schedule with a lower number takes place earlier than an appointment for a schedule with a higher number. 

 Based on the sequence settings you specify, a route execution will be built and the route distances and travel time will be calculated. For a particular route execution, you can change the order of appointments manually. 

#### Order Number Reset 

 You can reset the order numbers to the numbering defined by default by the system (that is, 00010, 00020, 00030, and so on) by clicking Reset Sequence on the form toolbar. The order of appointments will not be changed (only the numbering sequence). 

 Consider the following example. Suppose that the order 00010, 00020, and 00030 is set by default as order of the appointments for the schedules of Customer 1, Customer 2, and Customer 3, respectively. You then decide to change the order in which the customers are visited during a route execution; you want Customer 3 to be visited first, and then Customer 1 and Customer 2. To do this, you change the order number of the schedule of Customer 3 to a lower number, such as 00001. Now you have the following order: 

- 00001 for the schedules of Customer 3 

- 00010 for the schedules of Customer 1 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Routes | 11 

- 00020 for the schedules of Customer 2 Suppose that you then learn that the new order will not work for one of the customers. To revert to the system- assigned order, click **Reset Sequence**. The system updates the order numbers as follows: 

- 00010 for the schedules of Customer 3 

- 00020 for the schedules of Customer 1 

- 00030 for the schedules of Customer 2 

### Routes: To Add Drivers to a Route 

 You populate the list of drivers who can execute a route on the Routes (FS203700) form so you can later select any of these drivers for an execution of that route on the Route Document Details (FS304000) form. 

#### To Add Drivers to a Route 

1. Open the _Routes_ (FS203700) form. 

2. In the **Route ID** box, select the identifier of the route to which you want to add drivers. 

3. On the **Route Employees** tab, for each driver you want to be available to perform this route do the     following:     a. Click **Add Row**.     b. In the **Employee ID** column, select the identifier of the driver.     c. In the **Priority Preference** column, select the priority of the driver to execute the route. The lower the        digit, the higher the priority of the driver. 

4. Click **Save** on the form toolbar.

## Route Executions 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to efficiently manage route executions. You will discover how to create a route execution on the fly, review the appointments assigned to a driver, and view the route execution on a map. 

### Route Executions: Entry of Route Executions 

 To process the routes that are executed by your company, you have to create route execution documents in the system for each specific day when the route services are provided. You can create route executions in one of the following ways: 

- If your company regularly performs route services for a customer on a contract basis, you enter a route     service contract and set it up so that routes can be generated. 

- If your company performs services for the customer rarely or you have no contract that defines the details of     the services provided, you can create route execution documents manually. In this topic, you will learn how to enter a route execution manually. 

#### Entering a Route Execution Manually 

 You enter a route execution on the Route Document Details (FS304000) form. For the route execution, you specify the following information: 

- The route to which the route execution relates. 

- The date of the route execution. You can select a date that is one of the days of the week specified for the     associated route. 

- The driver or drivers who will perform the services of the route execution. 

- The vehicle or vehicles to be used for the route execution. 

- The values of the attributes defined for executions of the route. You can specify or modify the values of any     attributes that are listed on the **Attributes** tab; if the **Required** check box is selected for an attribute, you     must specify a value for it. Aer you have specified and saved this information, you can create and add appointments for the route execution by clicking **Create New Appointment** on the table toolbar and filling in information about each appointment on the _Appointments_ (FS300200) form. 

 You can assign to appointments on the route only services that are indicated as route services in the system (that is, they have the Route Service check box selected on the Services (FS400800) form). These services have to be assigned to the route service class (that, is the Route Service Class is selected on the Item Classes (IN201000) form). 

 By default, the system assigns a new route execution document the Open status. Reference numbers for new route execution documents are generated according to the numbering sequence specified in the Route Numbering Sequence box on the Routes tab of the Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. 

#### Viewing Route Statistics 

 The route execution statistics contain information about the number of appointments and services related to the executed route, the duration of activities related to it, and the total distance traveled. In the Summary area of the Route Document Details (FS304000) form ( Route Statistics section), you can view the route statistics for the selected route execution. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions | 13 

 The statistics can be calculated automatically by the system or the process of calculation can be invoked manually. If the Calculate Route Statistics Automatically check box is selected on the Routes tab of the Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, the system will automatically update the Route Statistics section if you make changes in the route execution. 

 If the Calculate Route Statistics Automatically check box is cleared, you have to click the Calculate Route Statistics button on the form toolbar of the Route Document Details form to recalculate statistics in the Route Statistics section. 

### Route Executions: Modification of a Route Execution 

 You can make changes to a route execution document created in the system on the Route Document Details (FS304000) form. Before the route execution is completed (that is, it has the Open or In Process status), you can perform the following changes: 

- Add an appointment to the route execution: If there is urgent appointment that needs to be performed or     no schedule has been created for some customer services, you can manually add an appointment to the     route execution. 

- Delete an appointment from the route execution: If the services of an appointment are not going to be     performed or the customer canceled the appointment, you can delete it from the route execution by     clicking the appointment line on the **Appointments** tab and clicking the **Delete Appointment** button on     the table toolbar. 

 If you delete an appointment from the route execution, it will be automatically deleted from all records in the system. 

- Change the order of appointments in the route execution: If necessary, you can change the order of the     appointments by clicking the appointment you want to move and clicking the **Move Up** or **Move Down**     button, depending on where in the route execution you want to move the appointment. 

 You can also change the order of appointments on the Routes on Map (FS300900) form. To do so, on the Routes tab, you drag and drop an appointment whose position in a route execution you want to change. 

- Assign an appointment to a different route execution: If the appointment is going to be performed on     another date or another route, you can move it to route execution of a different route or a route execution of     a different date. In route executions that are not yet closed (that is, route executions that have the _Open_ , _In Process_ , or _Completed_ status), you can make changes as follows.: 

- Change the date (it should correspond to the schedule for the route associated with this route execution)     and start time in the **Date** and **Start Time** boxes. 

- Add or reassign drivers and vehicles. 

### Route Executions: Generation of Appointments for Route Executions 

 In Acumatica ERP, the final step of processing a route service contract is generating the appointments for route executions. If a route execution for a specific day does not yet exist in the system, the system generates a route execution along with the appointments. If a route execution for a specific day exists in the system, the system generates appointments, and they are included in the existing route execution. 

 In this topic, you will read about how the appointments of route executions are generated for a route service contract and how the generation process can be canceled in the system. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions | 14 

#### Generating Appointments 

 You generate the route appointments in the system according to the route service contract schedules you have created. You can generate appointments manually or create an automation schedule to generate the appointments. For more information on scheduling automated processing, see Automated Processing: General Information. 

 To generate schedules manually, you use the Generate Route Appointments (FS500200) form. You can navigate directly to this form, or you can navigate to this form from the Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form by clicking the Generate Route Appointments button on the form toolbar. (This button becomes available aer you have specified the schedule recurrence settings and saved the route service contract schedule.) 

 On the Generate Route Appointments form, you can filter the list of schedules by route, and you should select the date range for which you want to generate schedules in the system. You can then generate route executions for all listed route service contract schedules or only those you select. 

 You can process the route executions with the generated appointments. 

#### Viewing Generation Processes 

 On the Run History tab of the Generate Route Appointments (FS500200) form, you can view information about the generation process, such as the date until which the appointments have been generated and the date when the appointments have been generated. 

### Route Executions: Assignment of Vehicles to Route Executions 

 To each route execution that you have created in the system, you have to assign at least one vehicle that is used to execute the route. 

 In this topic, you will read about assigning a vehicle (and possibly assigning additional vehicles) to route executions. 

#### Assigning the First Vehicle to Route Executions 

 You select the first vehicle that will be used to execute the route as follows: 

- To assign a vehicle to a particular route execution, you use the _Route Document Details_ (FS304000) form. In     the Summary area of this form, you select the route execution to which you want to assign the vehicle in     the **Route Nbr.** box, and you click the **Vehicle Selector** button. You then select the vehicle in the **Vehicle**     **Selector** dialog box, which opens. 

 Alternatively, you can select a vehicle by clicking the magnifier icon in the Vehicle box and selecting the driver in the Vehicle lookup table. 

- To assign vehicles to multiple route executions for a specific date range, you use the _Route Document_     _Worksheets_ (FS403900) form. On this form, for each route to which you want to assign a vehicle, you click     the line with the needed route and click **Assign Vehicle** on the table toolbar. You then select the vehicle in     the **Vehicle Selector** dialog box, which opens. 

 Alternatively, you can select a vehicle by clicking the magnifier icon in the Vehicle column and selecting the driver in the Vehicle lookup table. 

 In the Vehicle Selector dialog box, you select the first (and perhaps only) vehicle for the route of the document. This list contains all the vehicles that have not yet been assigned to any route on the day of the route execution. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions | 15 

 To select a particular vehicle, you click the line with the necessary vehicle in the table of the dialog box and click Select Vehicle. 

#### Assigning Additional Vehicles to Routes 

 If additional vehicles are necessary to perform the route service, you can assign up to two additional vehicles as follows: 

- To assign additional vehicles to a particular route execution on the _Route Document Details_ form (FS304000),     you select the second vehicle in the **Additional Vehicle 1** box and the third in the **Additional Vehicle 2** box.     You then save your changes by clicking **Save** on the form toolbar. 

- To assign additional vehicles to multiple route executions for a specific date range on the _Route Document_     _Worksheets_ (FS403900) form, for each needed route execution, you select the second vehicle in the     **Additional Vehicle 1** column and the third in the **Additional Vehicle 2** column. 

### Route Executions: Creating a Route Execution on the Fly 

 In this activity, you will learn how to create a route execution on the fly. You will also learn how to review the appointments of a driver assigned to the route execution and how to view the route execution on a map. 

 This activity is based on the U100 dataset. If you are using another dataset or if any system settings have been changed in U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity and the results of the processing. To avoid issues, restore the U100 dataset to its initial state. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that the service manager, Maia Davis, has received a request from the Thai Food Restaurant customer for the delivery of fruits for 1/31/2026. She needs to create a new route execution in the system with an appointment for the customer. The service manager will then review the schedule of the driver selected to perform the route execution, and view the created route execution on a map. Acting as the service manager, you will perform these actions in the system. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the _Route Management_ feature has been enabled. 

- On the _Service Management Preferences_ (FS100100) form, an API key has been specified in the **Map API Key**     box. 

- On the _Branch Locations_ (FS202500) form, the _WEST BRIGHTON_ branch location has been configured. 

- On the _User Profile_ (SM203010) form, the _WEST BRIGHTON_ branch location has been assigned as a default     branch location to the _davis_ user. 

- On the _Service Order Types_ (FS202300) form, the _ROUT_ service order type with the _Route_ behavior has been     configured to generate sales orders to bill customers for services that have been provided. That is, the **Sales**     **Orders** option has been selected under **Generated Billing Documents** in the **Billing Settings** section of the     **General** tab. 

- On the _Customers_ (AR303000) form, the _TOMYUM (Thai Food Restaurant)_ customer has been preconfigured,     and the _AP SO_ billing cycle has been selected in the **Service Management** section of the **Billing** tab. 

- On the _Non-Stock Items_ (IN202000) form, the _DELIVERY_ non-stock item has been configured, and the _Service_     type has been selected for it. For this item, the _DELIVERING_ item class has been selected, for which the     **Route Service Class** check box has been selected on the _Item Classes_ (IN201000) form.

## Route Executions with Service Delivery 

 To process the routes that are executed by your company, you have to create route execution documents in the system for each specific day when route services are provided. 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to create and process a route execution document that includes service delivery. 

### Route Executions with Service Delivery: General Information 

 A route execution is a predefined path with some stops to perform services or deliver and receive inventory items. Each stop in a route execution represents a route appointment, which is an appointment associated with a service order type configured with the Route behavior. A route execution is created for each specific day that route services are provided. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create a route execution document and add appointments to the route 

- View the route on the map 

- Modify the route execution document and edit the order of appointments in the route execution 

- Start, complete, and close the route execution 

- Run route appointment billing 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create routes and route executions when your company provides on-site services or deliveries to customers on specified service days. 

#### Ways of Creating Route Executions 

 To process each route executed by your company, you have to create a route execution document in the system for each specific day when a particular route is executed. Route executions can be created in the following ways: 

- Manual creation: If your company performs services for a customer rarely or does not have a contract that     defines the details of the services provided, you can create route execution documents manually. 

- Automated creation: If your company regularly provides route services for a customer on a contract basis,     you can create a route service contract. The system will then automatically generate route execution     documents based on the contract schedule. 

#### Manual Entry of a Route Execution 

 You enter a route execution on the Route Document Details (FS304000) form. For the route execution, you specify the following information: 

- The route to which the route execution relates. 

- The date of the route execution. You can select a date that is one of the days of the week specified for the     associated route. 

- The driver or drivers who will perform the services of the route execution. 

- The vehicle or vehicles to be used for the route execution. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions with Service Delivery | 25 

- The values of the attributes defined for executions of the route. You can specify or modify the values of any     attributes that are listed on the **Attributes** tab; if the **Required** check box is selected for an attribute, you     must specify a value for it. Aer you have specified and saved this information, you can add appointments to the route execution by clicking **Create New Appointment** on the table toolbar and entering the details of each appointment on the _Appointments_ (FS300200) form. 

 In the appointments on the route, you can include only services that are indicated as route services in the system—that is, they have the Route Service check box selected on the Services (FS400800) form. These services have to be assigned to a route service class, which is an item class for which the Route Service Class is selected on the Item Classes (IN201000) form. 

 By default, the system assigns a new route execution document the Open status. Reference numbers for new route execution documents are generated according to the numbering sequence specified in the Route Numbering Sequence box on the General tab of the Route Management Preferences (FS100400) form. 

#### Statuses of Route Executions 

 The statuses of route executions keep managers informed about the route service delivery. The system changes the status of each route execution based on user actions. A route execution has one of the following statuses, which is displayed for the route execution on the Route Document Details (FS304000) form: 

1. _Open_ : The route execution has been created and can be populated with route appointments. The system     assigns this default status when you create a new route execution. 

2. _In Process_ : A driver has started the route execution and will complete the route appointments. 

3. _Completed_ : The driver has finished all the activities related to the route execution. A route execution     document with this status can be reopened (returned to the _In Process_ status) or closed. 

4. _Closed_ : A manager has reviewed the record and confirmed that everything has been done. All administrative     activities for this route execution document are over. The document cannot be editedunless you reopen the     route execution, which causes it to be assigned the _Open_ status. 

#### Process Workflow 

 The process of executing a route in the system is shown in the diagram below. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions with Service Delivery | 26 

**_Figure: Route processing flow_** 

In general, the simplest way of executing a route involves the following steps: 

1. Creating the route: If a route has not been created yet, a manager creates a route with the common details     of the route to be executed. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Route Executions with Service Delivery | 27 

2. Creating route service contracts for the customers who require recurrent service appointments (optional):     The scheduler creates a route service contract and specifies a customer, a schedule with services to be     provided, and other settings. The scheduler then activates the contract. 

3. Setting up the sequence for scheduled appointments in contracts (optional): The scheduler reviews the     order in which customers will be visited during route execution and adjusts it as needed. 

4. Creating route executions with appointments: If route service contracts have been created for customers,     the scheduler generates appointments in the corresponding route execution in the order that is specified     in the route sequence. If route service contracts have not been created, the scheduler creates a route     execution manually. 

5. Adding details to the route execution: The scheduler assigns drivers and vehicles to the route execution     defined in the system. The scheduler can manually add or delete appointments in response to customer     requests. 

6. Starting to perform route services: On the day of the route execution, the driver locates the assigned route     execution in the system, reviews the details, proceeds to the starting location, and begins executing the     route. 

7. Attending the appointments of the route: At each appointment location, the driver starts the appointment,     performs the required services, and enters any additional information into the system (such as items picked     up or delivered), if needed. Once the work is completed and all details are reviewed, the driver marks the     appointment as complete in the system. The driver then proceeds to the next appointments associated with     the route execution and repeats the process. 

8. Completing the execution of the route: Once all appointments in the route execution have been completed,     the driver proceeds to the route's end location, records the end time, and finalizes the route execution. 

9. Closing the execution of the route: The accountant reviews the route document and its associated     appointments to verify the accuracy of the information, and then closes the route execution. 10.Generating billing documents for customers: An accountant generates billing documents for completed or     closed appointments. 

### Route Executions with Service Delivery: To Create a Route Execution with 

### Appointments 

 This activity will walk you through the process of creating a route execution document, scheduling the route execution for a specific day and time, adding a route appointment, and viewing the route on a map. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that the HM's Bakery & Cafe customer has requested the juicer demonstration service, which will be performed at the customer's location. Acting as a service manager (Maia Davis) of the SweetLife Service and Equipment Sales Center, you will create a route execution document that includes one trip to the HMBAKERY customer for the demonstration. You will schedule the route for a specific day and time (next Thursday at 10:00 AM) and add the route appointment, where you will select the customer and the service to be performed. You will also view the route on a map. 

#### Process Overview 

 On the Route Document Details (FS304000) form, you will create a route execution document and specify the scheduled start time, driver, and vehicle. Then you will add an appointment to the route execution and view the route on the map.

### Route Executions with Service Delivery: To Modify the Route Execution 

 This activity will walk you through the process of modifying the existing route execution document and reassigning a route appointment from one route execution to another one. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has requested the juicer demonstration service to be performed at the customer's location. At the same time, the HM's Bakery & Cafe customer, for which a route execution document has been created, has asked to change the date of the service that has been scheduled for them. 

 A service manager (Maia Davis) of the SweetLife Service and Equipment Sales Center analyzed the route execution dates, confirmed them with the customers, and decided to combine these route executions to be performed within one route execution because they were requested for the same day. Acting as this service manager, you will modify the date in the route execution that was previously created for the HM's Bakery & Cafe customer and add an additional appointment for the Thai Food Restaurant customer.

 Managing Route Service Contracts | 42 

## Managing Route Service Contracts 

 You can process and track contracts for recurring services that require a route to be performed. A route service contract represents a document that contains information on the predefined services that are going to be performed at the predefined frequency, according to the agreement between the customer and the company. 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can create service contracts with different billing options, which you set up depending on the company's needs. 

### Route Service Contracts: General Information 

 With Acumatica ERP's integrated route and service management capabilities, you can manage appointments associated with routes. Routes can be generated automatically from contracts or created manually for a specific day. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Create a route for the service contract, and then create a service contract 

- Create a schedule for the route service contract 

- Specify the order in which the appointments for the route will be generated 

- Generate appointments for the service contract 

- Find the generated route execution documents in the system and assign drivers and vehicles to them 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You create and process a route service contract when you and the customer have agreed to the terms of regular deliveries of some inventory items. 

#### Process Diagram 

 In general, when processing a route service contract, your employees perform the following steps: 

1. Creating the route service contract: The service manager enters the route service contract into the system. 

2. Creating at least one schedule: The scheduler creates one or more schedules for service delivery based on     the route contract. 

3. Activating the service contract: The scheduler activates the route service contract in the system so that     appointments can be generated for the contract schedules. 

4. Reviewing and adjusting the appointment order: The scheduler reviews the order of appointments     generated for the contract within a route execution and can adjust it if needed. 

5. Generating appointments on the route: The scheduler generates the appointments based on the contract     and schedule. 

6. Creating the appointments on the fly: If a related schedule has not been created or additional appointments     are needed, the scheduler creates appointments. 

7. Generating and processing billing documents for the service orders or appointments: An accountant     approves service orders or appointments for the generation of billing documents. An accountant then     generates billing documents for the service orders and appointments and processes them in the system.

8. Modifying the next billing period (optional): If any changes are necessary, the scheduler modifies the next     billing period and can add or delete services and non-stock items for it. The scheduler can also modify the     quantity and prices of the existing items. 

9. Activate the next billing period (optional): If the **Automatically Activate Upcoming Period** check box is not     selected on the _Route Management Preferences_ (FS100400) form, the scheduler activates the next billing     period for the contract. 10.Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while, the scheduler can     suspend the contract. 11.Canceling the contract (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the services for the     contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can cancel the contract. This step can     be performed aer your company has started to provide services according to the contract. 

The following diagram shows the general process related to route service contracts billed at the time of service.

### Route Service Contracts: Billing Types 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can create service contracts with different billing types. When you create a service contract, you specify the billing type that corresponds to your company needs. In this topic, you will learn in more details about available billing types. 

 In the following sections of this topic, these capabilities are described in detail for service contracts created on the Service Contracts form. The capabilities work similarly for a route service contract created on the Route Service Contracts form. 

#### Service Contracts Billed at the Time of Service 

 You can create service contracts to be billed at the time of service, and perform the contract billing based on what was done in appointments when each particular appointment took place, or based on what was estimated in the service order. For this type of a service contract, on the Summary tab of the Service Contracts (FS305700) form, you select At Time of Service in the Billing Type box. 

 When creating a service contract, you define either appointments or service orders will be generated for the service contract. In the Schedule Generation Type box of the Summary tab on the Service Contracts form, you specify one of the following options: 

- _Appointments_. You select this option if you know the date and time when the visit to a customer should     occur. Aer the system generates an appointment, the date and time can be changed. 

- _Service Orders_. You select this option if you do not know the exact date and time when the visit to a     customer should happen but you know the time frame. Aer the service order is generated, you define the     date and time when the visit will occur according to the employees availability, and the confirmation from     the customer. Then you define which prices will be used for the items specified in the service contract. In the **Take Prices From** box on the **Summary** tab of the _Service Contracts_ form, you specify one of the following options: 

- _Contract_. When you select this option, the system copies the rows from the **Details** tab of the _Service_     _Contract Schedules_ form to the **Prices** tab of the _Service Contracts_ form. On this tab, you can manually     specify the price for each item in the contract, and save your changes to the contract. 

- _Regular Price_. When you select this option, the system uses the prices according to the rules of automatic     price selection, that is the prices specified form a service or inventory item in the **Default Price** box of the     _Non-Stock Items_ (IN202000) or _Stock Items_ (IN202500) form, or in the price list on the _Sales Prices_ (AR202000)     form at the date when an appointment or a service order is created. 

 The prices agreed by the service contract will only be applied to the line items added to the Details tab on the Service Contract Schedules form. If an additional item is added manually to the service order or appointment when it has been already generated, the system will use the price selected according to the standard rules of automatic price selection. 

 On the Schedules tab, you create a schedule for generating appointments or service orders. On the table toolbar, you click Add Schedule , the system opens the Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form. On the Details tab of this form, you specify the services or inventory items (or both) to be included in the appointments or services, and on the Recurrence tab, you set up schedule settings. Then, you save the schedule and close the form. The system returns you on the Service Contracts form, and adds a line with the created schedule on the Schedules tab. 

 Then you click Activate on the More menu to assign the service contract the Active status.

#### Service Contracts Billed at the End of the Period 

 You can create and process service contracts that are billed at the end of the billing period. This billing type assumes that at the end of the billing period, for the service contract, you generate an invoice, which includes a fixed price for a service or services (for example, for a fixed number of hours or visits) specified in the contract plus an amount for an overage number of hours, visits, or materials that has been added to the service document (an appointment or service order) during the billing period but has not been covered by the service contract. 

 For this type of a service contract, on the Summary tab of the Service Contracts (FS305700) form, you select EndPeriod Plus in the Billing Type box, and in the Billing Type Settings section, specify the billing period ( Week , Month , Quarter , Half a Year , or Year ) in the Period box. 

 On the Services per Period tab of the Service Contracts form, you add a line for each service to be provided during each billing period. In each line, you select a service or non-stock item. For each item, you specify the quantity in the Value column, and the price that is paid for the specified quantity of the items in the Recurring Item Price column. You also specify the price to be used when the specified quantity has been exceeded during the period in the Overage Item Price column. 

 On the Schedules tab, you create a schedule for generating appointments or service orders. On the table toolbar, you click Add Schedule , the system opens the Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form. On the Details tab of this form, you specify the services or inventory items (or both) to be included in the appointments or service orders, and on the Recurrence tab, you set up schedule settings. Then, you save the schedule and close the form. The system returns you on the Service Contracts form, and adds a line with the created schedule on the Schedules tab. 

 Besides appointments and service orders generated from a schedule or schedules, a service order or an appointment can also be created on the fly, and assigned to the service contract. 

 At the end of each billing period, you generate an invoice for a service contract. The invoice includes a fixed number of hours or visits at a price predefined in the service contract. If the number of hours or visits defined in the service contract has been exceeded during the billing period, the price that has been specified for overage items is applied. The items that are not covered by the service contract but have been used in appointments or service orders during the billing period are also included in the invoice generated at the end of the period. 

#### Service Contracts with Beginning-Period Fixed Billing 

 You can create and manage service contracts with fixed billing at the beginning of the billing period. This billing type assumes that at the beginning of the billing period, for a service contract, you generate an invoice that includes a fixed price specified in the contract. This fixed price covers all services and inventory items listed in the contract, and provided to the customer during the billing period. If any additional services or materials are used in appointments (that is, are added to service documents) during the billing period, these items are not billed— once you have run billing for an appointment or a service order, the generated invoice will have a zero total amount specified. For this type of a service contract, on the Summary tab of the Service Contracts (FS305700) form, you select Beginning-Period Fixed in the Billing Type box, and specify the billing period ( Week , Month , Quarter , Half a Year , or Year ) in the Period box. On the Services per Period tab of the form, for each service to be provided during each period, you add an item (for example, a non-stock item that represents a contract deposit) and specify the flat-rate price that has to be paid at the beginning of each billing period. 

 On the Schedules tab, you create a schedule for generating appointments or service orders. On the table toolbar, you click Add Schedule , the system opens the Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form. On the Details tab of this form, you specify the services or inventory items (or both) to be included in the appointments or service orders, and on the Recurrence tab, you set up schedule settings. Then, you save the schedule and close the form. The system returns you on the Service Contracts form, and adds a line with the created schedule on the Schedules tab. 

 Note that for a service contract with the Beginning-Period Fixed billing type, you can either generate appointments or service orders based on a schedule, or create a service document (appointment or service order) on the fly, and 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 47 

 associate it with the service contract by specifying the service contract reference number in the Service Contract box on the Summary area of the Appointments (FS300200) or Service Orders (FS300100) form. 

 You can set up the deferral of the invoice amount by specifying the code in the Deferral Code column so that aer the service contract invoice has been released, the system creates a deferral schedule. 

 At the beginning of each billing period, on the Run Service Contract Billing (FS501300) form, you generate an invoice that contains the fixed contract price. 

 When you run billing for a service order or an appointment during the billing period, the system generates an invoice with the total amount set to zero because the items specified in the service order or appointment linked to the service contract are covered by the contract price. 

 On occasion, a service may be needed that is not covered by the fixed contract price. If this happens, you can edit the appointment or service order by clearing the Free Item check box in the needed detail line on the Details tab of the Appointments (FS300200) or Service Orders (FS300100) form. This causes the system to update the total amount of the appointment (and thus update the related billing document). 

#### Service Contracts with Beginning-Period Plus Billing 

 You can create and manage service contracts with fixed billing at the beginning of the billing period for the items specified in the service contract only. This billing type assumes that at the beginning of the billing period, for a service contract, you generate an invoice, which includes a fixed price specified in the contract. This fixed price covers all services and inventory items listed in the contract, and provided to the customer during the billing period. If any additional items (those that are not included in the service contract) have been used in appointments (that is, have been added to the service document) during the billing period, these items are billed separately. 

 For this type of a service contract, on the Service Contracts (FS305700) form, you specify the Beginning-Period Plus option in the Billing Type box. On the Services per Period tab, you add an item (for example, a non-stock item that represents a contract deposit), and specify its flat-rate price that have to be paid at the beginning of each billing period. On the Billing Type Settings section of the Summary tab, you specify the length of the billing period. 

 On the Schedules tab, you create a schedule for generating appointments or service orders. On the table toolbar, you click Add Schedule , the system opens the Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form. On the Details tab of this form, you specify the services or inventory items (or both) to be included in the appointments or service orders, and on the Recurrence tab, you set up schedule settings. Then, you save the schedule and close the form. The system returns you on the Service Contracts form, and adds a line with the created schedule on the Schedules tab. 

 For a service contract with the Beginning-Period Plus billing type, you can either generate appointments or service orders based on a schedule, or create a service document (appointment or service order) on the fly, and associate it with the service contract by specifying the service contract reference number in the Service Contract box on the Summary area of the Appointments (FS300200) or Service Orders (FS300100) form. Note that if you need certain predefined services to occur periodically, on the Service Contract Schedules , create a schedule or schedules, and on the Details tab, add these services, and in the detail lines, specify None in the Billing Rule column. 

 You can set up the deferral of the invoice amount by specifying the code in the Deferral Code column so that aer the service contract invoice has been released, the system creates a deferral schedule. 

 At the beginning of the billing period, on the Run Service Contract Billing (FS501300) form, you generate an invoice that contains the fixed contract price. During the billing period, for an appointment or a service order (depending on the option specified in the Schedule Generation Type box on the Service Contracts box), you generate additional billing document.

### Route Service Contracts: To Create and Process Service Contract Billed at the Time 

### of Service 

 With a route service contract, which is based on the agreement between the customer and the company, the predefined route services are performed at the agreed-upon frequency. In the system, a route service contract contains basic information—such as the customer, customer location, and dates—and the schedule or schedules associated with the contract. A route contract schedule defines the route service (or services), inventory items, and other settings that the generated appointments of route executions will have. It also specifies the recurrence of the generation of these appointments. 

 In this activity, you will learn how to create a route service contract billed at the time of service, and generate appointments for it. 

#### Story 

 Suppose that the GoodFood One Restaurant and HM's Bakery and Cafe customers have each agreed to the terms of separate contracts with Sweet Life for the delivery of fruits every week on Tuesday and Thursday. The service manager of Sweet Life, Maia Davis, needs to create route service contracts and schedules for the generation of appointments. She will then specify the order in which customers will be visited during route execution. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as a service manager. 

#### Configuration Overview 

 In the U100 dataset, the following tasks have been performed to support this activity: 

- On the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, the _Service Management_ and _Route Management_ features     have been enabled. 

- On the _Branch Locations_ (FS202500) form, the _WEST BRIGHTON_ branch location has been configured.     This branch location has been assigned as a default branch location to the _davis_ user on the _User Profile_     (SM203010) form. 

- On the _Service Order Types_ (FS202300) form, the _ROUT_ service order type with the _Route_ behavior has been     configured to generate sales orders to bill customers for services that have been provided. That is, the     **Sales Orders** option button has been selected under **Generated Billing Documents** in the **Billing Settings**     section of the **General** tab. 

- On the _Customers_ (AR303000) form, for the _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_ and _HMBAKERY (HM's_     _Bakery and Cafe)_ customer, the _AP AP_ billing cycle has been selected in the **Service Management** section of     the **Billing Settings** tab. 

- On the _Routes_ (FS203700) form, the _NY2_ route has been configured with executions on Tuesdays and     Thursdays starting at 9:00 AM. 

- On the _Non-Stock Items_ (IN202000) form, the _DELIVERY_ non-stock item has been configured, and the _Service_     type has been selected for it. For this item, the _DELIVERING_ item class has been selected, for which the     **Route Service Class** check box has been selected on the _Item Classes_ (IN201000) form. 

#### Process Overview 

 To process route service contracts billed at the time of service, you create service contracts on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form, and create schedules for the generation of appointments on the Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form. You then review the sequence in which customers will be visited during route executions and modify it on the Route Sequences (FS303800) form. Finally, you generate the appointments that are stops during the route execution on the Generate Maintenance from Contract Schedules (FS500300) form.

#### System Preparation 

 To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following: 

1. Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the _U100_ dataset preloaded; you should     sign in as a service manager by using the _davis_ username and the _123_ password. 

2. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the     business date in your system is set to _1/30/2026_. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu     button, and select the _1/30/2026_ date from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and     process all documents in the system on this business date. 

#### Step 1: Creating Route Service Contracts 

 To create both route service contracts for the customers, do the following: 

1. Open the _Route Service Contracts_ (FS300800) form. 

2. On the form toolbar, click **Add New Record** , and specify the following settings: 

- **Customer** : _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_ 

- **Description** : Delivery Contract 

3. On the **Summary** tab, specify the following settings of the contract:

- **Billing Type** : _At Time of Service_ 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Save**. 

5. Repeat Instructions 2–6 to create a route service contract for _HMBAKERY (HM's Bakery and Cafe)_ ; only the     **Customer** setting is different than the settings specified for _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_. 

#### Step 2: Creating Route Service Contract Schedules 

 To create route service contract schedules for the route service contracts you have created, do the following: 

1. While you are still viewing the service contract for _HMBAKERY (HM's Bakery and Cafe)_ on the _Route Service_     _Contracts_ (FS300800) form, on the **Schedules** tab, click **Add Schedule**.     The _Route Service Contract Schedules_ (FS305600) form opens. 

2. In the **Service Order Type** box of this form, ensure _RTE_ is selected. 

3. On the **Details** tab, add a row and specify the following settings: 

- **Line Type** : _Service_ 

- **Inventory ID** : _DELIVERY_ 

4. On the **Recurrence** tab, in the **Frequency** box, select **Weekly** , and do the following in the **Weekly Settings**     section: 

- Leave **Every** _1_ **Weeks**. 

- Select the **Tuesday** and **Thursday** check boxes.

8. Open the _Route Service Contracts_ form with the created contract for _GOODFOOD (Good Food Restaurant)_. 

9. Repeat Instructions 1–7 to create a route service contract schedule with the same settings and activate the     contract for _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_. 

#### Step 3: Specifying the Route Order 

 To change the default order of appointments in route executions, do the following: 

1. Open the _Route Sequences_ (FS303800) form. 

2. In the **Route** box, select _NY2_.     For the _NY2_ route definition, the system shows the sequence in which the appointments will be generated. 

3. In the **Order** column, type 00005 in the line with the _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_ customer. 

4. On the form toolbar, click **Save**.     Notice that the order has changed. 

5. On the toolbar, click **Reset Sequence**.     The order numbers have been updated with the first two numbers of the default sequence but kept the     specified order. 

#### Step 4: Generating Route Appointments 

 To generate route appointments based on the route service contract, do the following: 

1. Open the _Generate Route Appointments_ (FS500200) form. 

2. Specify the following settings: 

- **Route** : _NY2_ 

- **Generate Up To** : _2/15/2026_ 

3. On the form toolbar, click **Process All**.     The system opens the **Processing** pop-up window, in which you can see the status of the process. 

4. Aer the processing has successfully completed, click **Close**. 

#### Step 5: Reviewing the Generated Route Appointments 

 To view the generated route appointments, do the following: 

1. Open the _Routes on Map_ (FS300900) form. 

2. In the Date box, select the _2/15/2026_ date for which you have generated a route execution. 

3. Click the arrow button le of the route execution number in the **Routes** section to view the appointment     details of this route execution for the selected day.     Appointments for the _GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)_ and _HMBAKERY (HM's Bakery and Cafe)_     customers have been generated within one route execution.

### Route Service Contracts: Renewal of a Service Contract 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can create and process a renewable service contract. 

 In the following sections of this topic, the capability is described in detail for service contracts created on the Service Contracts (FS305700) form. The capability works similarly for a route service contract created on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form. 

#### Creation of a Renewable Service Contract 

 You create a renewable service contract on the Service Contracts (FS305700) form. When creating a service contract, on the Summary tab of the form, you select the Renewable option in the Expiration Type box, which causes the Duration box to appear on the form. In this box, you specify the time period until the next expiration date. Once you save and activate the service contract, the system inserts the date in the Expiration Date box, which is calculated based on the specified duration. 

#### Renewal of a Service Contract 

 You can renew a service contract with the Active status before or aer its expiration date. On the More menu of the Service Contracts (FS305700) form, you click the Renew command (under Processing ). This command is available when a renewable service contract—one with Renewable selected in the Expiration Type box in the Contract Settings section—has been activated. 

 When you renew a service contract, its expiration date is moved forward by the specified duration. A renewed service contract keeps the settings of the original contract, including the schedules that have been generated. When you click Renew , the system determines the contract renewal date based on the contract expiration date. The new renewal date is the day aer the previous expiration date. The system inserts this date in the Renewal Date box and updates the date in the Expiration Date box based on the period specified in the Duration box. 

 A service contract can be renewed multiple times. Each time you click Renew , the system moves the renewal and expiration dates forward by the amount of time specified in the Duration box. 

 You can renew multiple service contracts at once by using the Process Service Contracts (FS501200) form. In the Action box of the Selection area, select Renew , then in the list of contracts, select service contracts to be renewed, and on the form toolbar, click Process All. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 52 

### Route Service Contracts: Copying a Service Contract 

 A service contract can be copied. You may need to copy a service contract when a customer is due for renewal but some settings of the existing contract should be changed, or you just need another service contract with the similar settings. 

 In the following sections of this topic, the capability is described in detail for service contracts created on the Service Contracts form. The capability work similarly for a route service contract created on the Route Service Contracts form. 

#### Copying a Service Contract 

 You copy a service contract by clicking Copy on the More menu on the Service Contracts (FS305700) form (or on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form). Once you click Copy , the Copy Contract dialog box opens. In the dialog box, you specify the start date of the new service contract and of any schedules that have been generated for the service contract. 

 When you copy a service contract, the system creates a new contract with the Dra status with most of the same settings (and similar generated schedules) as those specified in the original service contract. In the copied service contract, you can modify the following settings (even if the service contract has schedules associated with it): Customer , Location , Billing Customer , Billing Location , Project , Start Date , Expiration Type , and Expiration Date. 

 On the History tab of the Service Contracts form, you can review which actions have been performed for the contract and when, as well as view the reference numbers of the original service contract and schedule. 

 When you change the contract start date or end date (or both), the schedule start date or end date (or both) are updated accordingly if the contract start date is equal to the schedule start date, and the contract end date is equal to the schedule end date. If the contract start date differs from the start date of the schedule, or the contract end date differs from the contract end date, you should ensure that the new contract start date is not later than the schedule start date, and the contract end date is not earlier than the schedule end date. 

### Route Service Contracts: Contract Activation 

 In Acumatica ERP, you have to activate a route service contract in the system to be able to generate appointments and billing documents for the contract. You can activate a dra of a contract for the first time or activate previously suspended contract. For the activated contracts, you cannot change the billing type and date information of route service contracts. 

 In this topic, you will read about activation of the dra contracts and suspended contracts. 

#### Activating a Route Service Contract with the Dra Status 

 When you create a service contract in the system, the contract is automatically assigned the Dra status. When you finish entering the necessary information for the contract, you should activate the contract so that you can generate appointments and billing documents for it. 

 You activate the contract on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form by clicking Activate on the More menu (under Processing ). The system changes the status of the service contract to Active. For the activated contracts, you cannot change the billing type and date information of service contracts. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 53 

#### Activating a Service Contract with the Suspended Status 

 Contracts with the Suspended status can be activated again starting on a particular date (whether or not it is the current date). To activate a suspended service contract, you open the necessary contract on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form and click Activate on the More menu (under Processing ). The system opens the Activation Contract dialog box, in which you specify the starting date when the contract has to be activated. 

 If schedules have been generated for the service contract, you can view them in the table of the Activation Contract dialog box. You can change the date of the appointments to be generated when the contract is active. To do so, for each schedule, you select the check box in the Change Recurrence column. You then specify the date since which the service orders or appointments will be generated according to the schedule for the active contract in the Effective Recurrence Start Date column. The system recalculates the Next Execution date. 

 If the activation date is later than the current date, when you click OK to close the dialog box and return to the form, the Upcoming Status box contains Active (indicating that the service contract will be active) and the Effective Until Date box contains the activation date (indicating that the current status of Suspended is effective until the activation date. 

### Route Service Contracts: Contract Suspension 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can suspend an active contract so that it is no longer active during the time it is suspended. When you suspend the contract, the system deletes any documents that were generated on the suspension date or the dates that are aer it. You cannot generate appointments or billing documents from contracts with the Suspended status. The suspended contract can then be activated again or canceled. 

 In this topic, you will read about how to suspend the routу service contract in the system. 

#### Suspending a Route Service Contract 

 To suspend the contract, you open the necessary contract on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form, and click Suspend on the More menu (under Processing ). The system opens the Suspend Contract dialog box, where you specify the date since which the contract has to be suspended. 

 If this date is later than the current date, when you click OK in the dialog box to close the dialog box and return to the form, the system inserts Suspended into the Upcoming Status box and the suspension date into the Effective Until Date box (indicating that the current status is effective until the suspension date). If the suspension date is the same as the current date, when you click OK in the dialog box, the system assigns the Suspended status to the service contract. 

### Route Service Contracts: Contract Cancellation 

 In Acumatica ERP, if for some reason the services will no longer be provided for the customer, you can cancel the service contract if it has the Active or Suspended status. When you cancel the service contract, the system deletes any documents that were generated for the dates that are the same as or later than the cancellation date. A contract with the Canceled status is read-only. 

 In this topic, you will read about how to cancel the service contract in the system. 

#### Canceling a Route Service Contract 

 To cancel a service contract, you open the necessary contract on the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form, and click Cancel on the More menu (under Processing ). The system opens the Terminate Contract dialog box where you specify the date since which the contract has to be canceled. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 54 

 If this date is later than the current date, when you click OK in the dialog box to close it and return to the form, the system inserts Canceled in the Upcoming Status box (to indicate that the contract will be canceled) and inserts the cancellation date in the Effective Until Date box (to indicate that the current status is effective until this date). If the cancellation date is the same as the current date, when you click OK in the dialog box, the system assigns the Canceled status to the service contract. 

### Route Service Contracts: Contract Schedules 

 With Acumatica ERP, you can manage the schedules of the route service contracts. A route service contract schedule defines the route service (or services), inventory items, and other settings that the generated appointments of route executions will have, as well as the recurrence of the generation. 

 In this topic, you will read about creating a schedule and specifying its settings. 

#### Creating a Route Service Contract Schedule 

 You create a new service contract schedule by using the Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form, which opens when you click Add Schedule on the table toolbar on the Schedules tab of the Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form. (You can also open this form to view or edit an existing schedule by clicking a link in the Schedule ID column on this tab.) 

 In the Service Order Type box of the Route Service Contract Schedules form, you select a service order type that has the Route behavior assigned on the Service Order Types (FS202300) form. This type will be used for the service orders that will be generated according to the schedule. You then specify the other settings of the schedule as follows: 

- The services that are delivered, which you add on the **Details** tab 

- Any stock items involved in the route services, which you add on the **Details** tab 

- The schedule recurrence settings, which are specified on the **Recurrence** tab 

- The route related to the contract, which is selected on the **Routes** tab 

- Optionally, the values of the attributes related to the service orders or appointments generated from the     schedule, on the **Attributes** tab For a route service contract, you can create one schedule or multiple schedules. The system generates the reference numbers for schedules based on the reference number of the related route service contract and the sequence number of the schedule created for this route service contract ( _1_ for the first schedule, _2_ for the second, and so on). For example, if the route service contract has the reference number _000001_ in the system and you create the first schedule for this route service contract, the reference number of the schedule will be _000001-1_. You can view the list of schedules that have been created for a particular route service contract on the **Schedules** tab of the _Route Service Contract Schedules_ form. 

#### Defining Schedule Settings 

 On the Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form, for each schedule, you have to specify the recurrence frequency type and the schedule settings. Frequency type defines how oen the schedule appointments can be generated for the schedule. 

 The route can be executed only on the days specified in the route related to the contract. For details, see Routes: Entry of a Route. 

 On the Recurrence tab, you can select one of the following option buttons: 

- **Daily** : The schedule applies daily or every _x_ days. 

- **Weekly** : The schedule applies weekly or every _x_ weeks. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 55 

- **Monthly** : The schedule applies monthly or every _x_ months. 

- **Yearly** : The schedule applies yearly or every _x_ years. Aer you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as follows: 

- If you selected the **Daily** frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in days when the schedule     applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2     days,the schedule applies every other day. 

- If you selected the **Weekly** frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in weeks and the day or     days of the week when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday,     the schedule applies Monday of every other week. 

- If you selected the **Monthly** frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in months and the day or     days of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day: by the number     of the day of the month, or by the week of the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify     that the schedule repeats every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month.     You can specify up to four days for the **Monthly** frequency type by selecting and appropriate check box and     specifying days in the **Second Recurrence Monthly Settings** , **Third Recurrence Monthly Settings** , and     **Fourth Recurrence Monthly Settings** sections. 

- If you selected the **Yearly** frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in years, the month or     months of the year, and the day of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for     specifying the day of the month: by the number of the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the     2nd day of February and March), or by the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every     year on the 2nd Monday of February and March). If the **Enable Seasons in Schedule Contracts** check box is selected on the _Service Management Preferences_ (FS100100) form, you can also specify the months when the schedule is applicable for the **Daily** , **Weekly** , and **Monthly** frequency types in the **Season Settings** section of the _Route Service Contract Schedules_ form. 

### Route Service Contracts with the End-Period Billing: Billing Documents 

 For the service contracts with the End-Period Plus billing, at the end of each billing period, you have to generate a billing document (that is, an AR invoice or sales order) for the customer. The document includes the services and non-stock items that are covered by the contract, as well as other items included in the appointments related to the contract that were performed during the billing period. For the items that are covered by the contract, the document includes the price specified in the contract. If quantity of the items has been exceeded during the period, the overage quantity of items is included in the billing document with the overage price specified for the contract. 

 In this topic, you will read about how to generate billing documents for the route service contracts with the EndPeriod Plus billing in the system. 

#### Generating Billing Documents and Creating Batches 

 You specify the billing document generation settings (such as the type of the document to be generated) on the Route Management Preferences (FS100400) form as described in Route Management: General Information. 

 You generate the billing documents on the Run Service Contract Billing (FS501300) form. You specify the date of document creation, select all listed service contracts for which you want to bill a customer or multiple customers, and generate the documents. 

 When you generate these billing documents, the system creates a batch of generated billing documents on the Service Contract Billing Batches (FS306100) form. The system assigns the batch a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to batches in the Batch Numbering Sequence box on the Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. On the Run Service Contract Billing form, you click the batch number in the Batch Nbr. column to view information on the batch. The system opens the Service Contract Billing Batches (FS306100) form with the batch. On this form, you can find the contract reference number, the billing document date, the customer, the branch, and the next billing date for the contract. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Route Service Contracts | 56 

#### Processing Billing Documents 

 The appropriate employees process the generated billing documents. To open a generated billing document for the selected batch, you click the billing document number in the Document Nbr. column of the Service Contract Billing Batches (FS306100) form, and then process it in the system.

 Managing Week Codes | 57 

## Managing Week Codes 

 This chapter describes how to manage week codes in the system. 

### Creating Week Codes 

 The week code is a oneto four-digit recurrence system that you can use to reschedule the appointment in a multiple of four-week intervals. 

 The week code is directly related to the calendar. If a week with a 4-digit recurrence is defined, the rest of the calendar can be calculated. 

 The advantage of the week code system is that without generating a recurrence of an appointment, you can easily calculate the previous and next recurrences that have taken place or will take place. The disadvantage is that the recurrence can be set only in multiples of four weeks (that is, for example, every four or eight weeks. 

 The week codes are currently used for validation purposes in the Route Management module. The recurrence of the route will be taken from the Route Management recurrence form. 

#### Generation of the Calendar 

 Because the week code is calculated on a fixed calendar, the first step is to generate the calendar. This will define the correspondence between the week code and the calendar weeks. 

 To generate the weekcode calendar, you use the Calendar Week Codes (SD205900) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Week Codes | 58 

#### Structure of the week codes 

 The digits in the week codes indicate the following: 

- P1: The first digit can be 1, 2, 3 or 4, and this recurrence will happen every four weeks.     For example, if a route is set for week code 1, starting on the fourth week of January, the route will happen     every 4 weeks. But if the week code is 2, it will also happen every four weeks but starting in the fih week of     January. 

 The recurrence can be more than one week code. For example, a route can be on the week codes 1, 2, 3, or 4, meaning that it will be every week, or it can be 1, 3 or 2, 4, meaning it will be every two weeks, starting on the first or second week of the year. 

- P2: The second digit can be _A_ or _B_ , and the combination of the first and second digit will happen every eight     weeks.     For example, if a route is set to _1B_ , the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of January,     and the second appointment will be in the third week of March (that is, eight weeks later). 

- P3: The third digit can be _C_ , _D_ , _E_ , or _F_ , and the combination of the first, second, and third digits will happen     every 16 weeks.     For example, if a route is set to _1BF_ , the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of Januar,y     and the second appointment will be in the third week of May (that is, 16 weeks later). 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Week Codes | 59 

- P4: The fourth digit can be _S_ , _T_ , _U_ , _V_ , _W_ , _X_ , _Y_ , or _Z_. The combination of the first, second, third, and fourth     digits will happen every 32 weeks.     For example, if a route is set to _1BFZ_ , the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of January,     and the second appointment will be in the last week of August or first week of September (that is, 32 weeks     later).

#### Inquiry Form Toolbar Buttons 

 Acumatica ERP inquiry forms present data in a tabular format; they may also have selection criteria you can use to filter the data in the table. Predefined inquiry forms are provided as part of Acumatica ERP out of the box, and 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 71 

 inquiry forms can be designed by a user with the appropriate access rights by using the Generic Inquiry tool (for details, see Managing Generic Inquiries in the Acumatica ERP Reporting Tools Guide). A form toolbar of an inquiry form contains both the standard form toolbar buttons (described in the table above) and the additional buttons described below. 

 Button Icon Description 

 Refresh Refreshes the inquiry data in the table. 

 Cancel Clears all changes (including selection criteria that has been specified, if the generic inquiry form has this criteria) and restores the default settings. 

 Add New Record Initiates the creation of a new entity. 

 Edit Opens the applicable data entry form with the selected record. 

 Fit to Screen Expands the form to fit on the screen and adjusts the column widths proportionally. 

 Export to Excel Exports the data to an Excel file. For more information, see Integration with Excel in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. 

#### The More Menu and Form-Specific Buttons 

 If there are multiple form-specific commands on the form toolbar, they are displayed on a single menu—the More menu—and listed under descriptive categories, which makes it easier to find the needed menu command. On the More menu, you can easily define your favorite menu commands, which eases access to them. 

 On some forms, the system places a button (which is highlighted in green) on the form toolbar for the expected next command, which represents the likely next step to be performed on the selected record. The following screenshot, which shows the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form, illustrates an example of the form toolbar and the More menu, which contains categories and menu commands. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 72 

 Figure: The form toolbar of the Transactions form 

 The numbered items in the screenshot indicate the following: 

1. A highlighted button for the expected next command, which represents the next logical step to be     performed on the record selected on the form 

2. Another button for a command that is commonly performed on the form 

3. The More button, which you click to open the More menu 

4. The More menu with most form-specific menu commands and descriptive categories on it 

5. The star icon, which is used to mark the individual user's favorite commands on the form 

6. An unavailable command 

#### Favorite Commands 

 Based on your role in the company and your job duties, you may use some commands more oen than others. On the form toolbar, you can specify these commands as favorites. This will cause the system to duplicate the commands as form toolbar buttons, easing access to them. 

 To add a command to the form toolbar as a button, you open the More menu, hover over the needed command, and click the star icon when it appears. The yellow color of the star indicates that the command has been added to your favorites, and a button for the command appears on the form toolbar immediately. The following example shows two commands that have been added to the user's favorites on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form and thus added as buttons on the form toolbar.

 Favorites are individual to each user account, specific to a particular form, and preserved across user sessions. 

#### Highlighted Buttons and Commands 

 On some forms, the system applies predefined logic to commands for specific records. Based on this logic, the system may place a button on the form toolbar, highlight it using some color, or do both of these things. 

 If a command is the expected next command (that is, the command that is most likely to be clicked for a record with the current status), it is shown both on the form toolbar and on the More menu. The primary command on the form toolbar is highlighted in green (see Item 1 in the following screenshot), and on the More menu, it is marked with a green dot (Item 2). Below is an example of a cash transaction on the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form that has the On Hold status (Item 3). Before you can process it, you need to remove it from hold. Because Remove Hold is the next logical command, it is displayed as a button on the form toolbar and highlighted in green.

#### Unavailable Commands on the More Menu 

 By default, on the More menu, the system displays all commands that could be available for the form, based on the system configuration. Some of these commands may be unavailable (that is, they are listed but cannot be clicked). These are the commands that are not applicable to the record based on its current status or other factors. 

#### The Responsive Form Toolbar and More Menu 

 The form toolbar and the More menu have a responsive layout, meaning that they dynamically adjust to different screen sizes. When there is enough space, buttons for highlighted and favorite commands are displayed on the form toolbar. When the screen size decreases, the system moves the commands off the form toolbar one by one but keeps them on the More menu. 

 If there are multiple categories on the More menu, the categories and menu commands can be displayed in multiple columns on the More menu, depending on the screen size and the number of categories. When the screen size decreases, the system moves some categories and menu commands to the le to decrease the number of columns, and in the screens of the smallest size, all categories are displayed in one column. Below are two examples of the same menu in different screen sizes for a record on the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form.

### Table Toolbar 

 Each table on an Acumatica ERP form, tab, dialog box, or page has a table toolbar, which contains the buttons you can use to work with the details or objects of the table. A toolbar, shown in the following screenshot, includes buttons that are specific to the table, standard buttons that most table toolbars have, and the Search box (for some tables; for others, the Search box is displayed in the filtering area).
