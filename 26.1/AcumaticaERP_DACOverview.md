## DAC Overview 

 In Acumatica ERP, the data is stored in a database. However, users of Acumatica ERP do not access the database directly. Instead, they access the data access classes (DACs). A DAC is a programming object used to represent and provide access to a database table in the code of Acumatica ERP. 

 In this guide, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in various functional areas of Acumatica ERP and learn about their relations.

## Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs 

 By using the accounts payable functionality in Acumatica ERP, you can efficiently manage your company’s liabilities to vendors for purchased or received goods and services. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in accounts payable and learn about the relationships between them. 

### AP DACs: General Information 

 The system uses the accounts payable data access classes (DACs) to enter, monitor, maintain, and process the payments, invoices, and memos that the organization sends to its vendors. For details about the AP processes, see Accounts Payable. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following data: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the DACs of accounts payable, such as information about vendors,     locations, and addresses 

- Transactional data 

- Historical data 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review AP DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses accounts payable data. 

- You need to design a report that uses accounts payable data. 

- You need to customize the accounts payable functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project Editor_. 

- You need to customize the accounts payable functionality by writing customization code. 

#### Basic Relationships Between AP DACs 

 The following diagram illustrates the main relationships between accounts payable DACs. For detailed descriptions of the DACs and DAC fields, look for the needed DAC in the DAC Schema Browser. (For details about the DAC Schema Browser, see Data from Multiple Data Sources: DAC Schema Browser .)

 Figure: Relationships between AP DACs 

### AP DACs: Reference Data 

 In this topic, you can find information about the data access classes (DACs) that contain reference data that is used in most of the DACs in accounts payable, such as information about vendors, locations, and addresses. 

#### Accounts Payable Preferences 

 The general preferences for accounts payable are stored in the APSetup DAC. An administrative user can edit these preferences on the Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form. 

#### Vendors 

 The Vendors (AP303000) form is used to define business accounts that satisfy the following condition: BAccount.Type = VE OR BAccount.Type = VC. (That is, the business account is a vendor or both a vendor and a customer.) Business accounts of these types are extended with the information from the Vendor DAC, as shown in the following SQL query. 

 SELECT * FROM BAccount INNER JOIN Vendor ON BAccount.CompanyID = Vendor.CompanyID AND BAccount.BAccountID = Vendor.BAccountID 

 The Vendor DAC contains AP-specific business account data related to vendors, including default currency settings, credit terms, and tax reporting settings for tax agency vendors. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 8 

#### Locations 

 As is true of any other business account record, a Vendor record can have multiple Location records associated with it. The default vendor location is stored in the BAccount.DefLocationID field. 

 The Location DAC contains multiple AP-specific fields. The names of these fields start with the V prefix. Examples of these fields are shown in the following table. 

 Field Description 

 VTaxZoneID The default vendor TaxZone associated with the location. 

 VExpenseAcctID The default expense GL account associated with the location. 

 VAPAccountID The default AP account associated with the location. 

 VPaymentMethodID The default PaymentMethod that is for use in AP and associated with the location. 

 The tax zones and accounts specified in a Location record can be overridden at the document level. For example, if you specify a particular location in a vendor bill, the tax zone (APInvoice.TaxZoneID) has the default value copied from Location.VTaxZoneID, but a user can override this value with any other tax zone. 

 Vendor locations can be defined on the Vendor Locations (AP303010) form. 

#### Addresses and Contacts 

 Three types of addresses and contacts are defined for every vendor in the system: 

- The main contact and address, which are specified on the **General** tab of the _Vendors_ (AP303000) form.     The main contact and address are referenced by the BAccount.DefContactID and     BAccount.DefAddressID fields, respectively. 

- The default remittance contact and address, which are specified on the **Payment** tab of the _Vendors_ form.     These contact and address are referenced by the Location.VRemitContactID and     Location.VRemitAddressID fields of the vendor's default location (which is specified in     BAccount.DefLocationID). 

 The remittance Address and Contact records serve as templates for a bill-level address and contact. 

- The default shipper's contact and address, which are specified on the **Purchase Settings** tab of the _Vendors_     form.     These contact and address are referenced by the Location.DefContactID and     Location.DefAddressID of the vendor's default location (which is specified in     BAccount.DefLocationID). The selection of particular types of addresses and contacts is illustrated in the following SQL queries: 

- Selection of the main vendor address and contact 

 SELECT * FROM Vendor INNER JOIN BAccount ON BAccount.CompanyID = Vendor.CompanyID 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 9 

 AND BAccount.BAccountID = Vendor.BAccountID INNER JOIN Contact ON Contact.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID AND Contact.ContactID = BAccount.DefContactID INNER JOIN Address ON Address.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID AND Address.AddressID = BAccount.DefAddressID 

- Selection of the default remittance and shipper's address and contact 

 SELECT * FROM Vendor INNER JOIN BAccount ON BAccount.CompanyID = Vendor.CompanyID AND BAccount.BAccountID = Vendor.BAccountID INNER JOIN Location -Default Location ON Location.CompanyID = Vendor.CompanyID AND Location.LocationID = BAccount.DefLocationID LEFT JOIN Contact AS DefaultRemittanceContact ON DefaultRemittanceContact.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND DefaultRemittanceContact.ContactID = Location.VRemitContactID LEFT JOIN Address AS DefaultRemittanceAddress ON DefaultRemittanceAddress.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND DefaultRemittanceAddress.AddressID = Location.VRemitAddressID LEFT JOIN Contact AS DefaultShipperContact ON DefaultShipperContact.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND DefaultShipperContact.ContactID = Location.DefContactID LEFT JOIN Address AS DefaultShipperAddress ON DefaultShipperAddress.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND DefaultShipperAddress.AddressID = Location.DefAddressID 

#### Vendor Payment Method Details 

 The VendorPaymentMethodDetail DAC stores vendor-specific values for AP-related payment method settings (which are stored in PaymentMethodDetail ). These settings are edited on the Payment tab of the Vendor Locations (AP303010) form. For the main vendor location, they can also be specified on the Payment tab of the Vendors (AP303000) form. 

#### Discount Codes and Sequences 

 APDiscount represents an accounts payable discount code that is used to define discount sequences (which are stored in VendorDiscountSequence ). The primary function of a discount code is to specify the type of discounts that are based on that code. For example, a document discount can be applicable only to specific vendors, or a line discount can be applicable to specific inventory items. The APDiscount records are defined on the Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form. 

 VendorDiscountSequence represents a specific discount sequence based on a discount code. The discount sequence specifies how the discount is calculated based on the amount or quantity of the line item, or on the amount of the document. Discount sequences can be defined on the Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. 

 In the following examples, a discount code defines a type of discount, including its applicability, while discount sequences based on this code specify to which specific entities the discount applies: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 10 

- Suppose that a discount code specifies a type of document-level discounts that are applicable to specific     vendors. The discount sequence defines this discount as being applicable to the A, B, and C vendors, and     provides a 50% discount if the line amount is greater than $200. 

- Suppose that a discount code specifies a type of line-level discounts that are applicable to specific     inventory items. The discount sequence defines this discount as being for the D, E, and F inventory items,     and provides a $25 discount if the document amount is greater than $1000. 

#### Price Lists 

 The system uses the APVendorPrice DAC to suggest the unit cost in document details (that is, the unit cost that is stored in the APTran.UnitCost field) that the user inserts into a bill or adjustment. The records store inventory item prices broken down by the following: 

- Vendor 

- Warehouse 

- Inventory item 

- Currency 

- Unit of measure 

- Break quantity 

- An indicator of whether the price is promotional All these fields form the compound key of vendor price records, meaning that they should be unique across the combination of these dimensions. 

 All existing vendor prices are defined on the Vendor Prices (AP202000) form. Also, a user can update the APVendorPrice records indirectly by creating and releasing AP price worksheets, which are stored in APPriceWorksheet and are editable on the Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010) form. The system uses the details of a price worksheet (which are stored in APPriceWorksheetDetail ) to automatically update the APVendorPrice records once the user releases a worksheet. 

### AP DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that provide transactional data—that is, the DACs that store the accounts payable documents and related entities. 

#### APRegister, APInvoice, and APPayment 

 All AP documents are stored in the APRegister DAC. Depending on the type of the document (which is specified in APRegister.DocType), the APRegister DAC is extended by APInvoice , by APPayment , or by both DACs. The following table shows how the APRegister DAC is extended depending on the document type specified on the data entry form. In this table, + indicates that the corresponding record exists for this document type, and indicates that the record does not exist. 

 Document Type APRegister.DocType 

 Purpose APRegister APInvoice APPayment 

 Bill INV A bill from a vendor for goods and services shipped on credit. 

##### + + 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 11 

**Document Type APRegister.DocType** 

 Purpose APRegister APInvoice APPayment 

_Debit Adj. ADR_ A memo indicating that money is owed by the vendor, due to such factors as a mistake in the bill. 

##### + + + 

_Credit Adj. ACR_ A memo that additional money is owed to the vendor, due to such factors as a mistake in the bill. 

 Conceptually, this type is similar to a bill. 

##### + + 

_Prepayment PPM_ A payment made in advance of goods and services shipped by the vendor. 

 + Optional (see details in AP Prepayment Specifics ) 

##### + 

_Cash Purchase QCK_ A purchase of goods and services for which a payment was made immediately. 

 Essentially, this type is a combination of a bill and a payment. 

##### + + + 

_Voided Cash Purchase_ 

 VQC A reversing document for a cash purchase. 

##### + + + 

_Payment CHK_ A payment made to the vendor for goods or services shipped on credit. 

##### + + 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 12 

 Document Type APRegister.DocType 

 Purpose APRegister APInvoice APPayment 

 Voided Payment VCK A reversal document for a payment, which cancels the payment's impact on the system. 

##### + + 

 Refund REF A full or partial refund of money received from the vendor. 

##### + + 

 Voided Refund VRF A canceled refund. 

##### + + 

AP documents are defined on the following forms: 

- Most documents that store their data in APInvoice: The _Bills and Adjustments_ (AP301000) form 

- Most documents that store their data in APPayment: The _Checks and Payments_ (AP302000) form 

- Cash purchases and voided cash purchases: The _Cash Purchases_ (AP304000) form 

- Debit adjustments: The _Bills and Adjustments_ form, on which the debit adjustment is created and released;     the _Checks and Payments_ form, on which the debit adjustment is applied to bills and credit adjustments 

The selection of the following types of documents is illustrated in the queries shown below: 

- The selection of invoices 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister INNER JOIN APInvoice ON APRegister.CompanyID = APInvoice.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APInvoice.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APInvoice.RefNbr 

- The selection of payments 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister INNER JOIN APPayment ON APRegister.CompanyID = APPayment.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APPayment.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APPayment.RefNbr 

- The selection of cash purchases and voided cash purchases 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister INNER JOIN APInvoice 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 13 

 ON APRegister.CompanyID = APInvoice.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APInvoice.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APInvoice.RefNbr INNER JOIN APPayment ON APRegister.CompanyID = APPayment.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APPayment.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APPayment.RefNbr WHERE -This condition is required because credit memos -have both the invoice part and the payment part. APRegister.DocType IN ('QCK', 'VQC') 

#### AP Prepayment Specifics 

 A user can create an AP prepayment on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form. In this case, the full entity consists of the APRegister record and the corresponding APPayment record. 

 However, the user can also create a prepayment request on the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. In this case, the prepayment also includes an APInvoice record. The APPayment part is created by the system automatically when a user applies a separate payment to the prepayment request. In this scenario, the full prepayment entity consists of three records: APRegister, APInvoice, and APPayment. 

 The purpose of the prepayment request workflow is to specify the goods and services for which the prepayment is made. (The goods and services are saved as the APTran lines of APInvoice.) The APInvoice part of a prepayment request is a technical entity: It does not generate GL batches upon release. 

#### Applications Between AP Documents 

 An APAdjust record indicates the application of one AP document to another, which results in an adjustment of the balances of both documents. This record contains the foreign key links between two documents, as well as the application amounts and other auxiliary information. 

 In most cases, an APAdjust record is an application of a payment-like document (that is, a document that includes an APPayment record) to an invoice-like document (that is, a document that includes an APInvoice record), such as an application of a payment to a bill. Sometimes an APAdjust record can also be an application between two payment-like documents, such as an application of a refund to a prepayment. 

 A user can create and edit the entities of the APAdjust type on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) form. On this form, applications are displayed as details of APPayment on the Documents to Apply tab. You can also see applications on the Applications tab of the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. 

 The following SQL query selects released documents with all incoming and outgoing released applications. 

 SELECT APRegister.CompanyID, APRegister.DocType, APRegister.RefNbr, -The original document amount APRegister.OrigDocAmt, -The open document balance APRegister.DocBal, -The total amount applied to the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjAmt, 0)) AS AdjdAmt, -The total cash discount taken on the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjDiscAmt, 0)) AS AdjdDiscAmt, -The total gain or loss realized on the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.RGOLAmt, 0)) AS AdjdRGOLAmt, 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 14 

 -The total withholding tax amount written off the document during the application to it SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjWhTaxAmt, 0)) AS AdjdWhTaxAmt, -The total amount applied by the document to other documents SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjAmt, 0)) AS AdjgAmt, -The total cash discount taken on other documents after the application of the document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjDiscAmt, 0)) AS AdjgDiscAmt, -The total gain or loss realized on other documents after the application of this document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.RGOLAmt, 0)) AS AdjgRGOLAmt, -The total withholding tax amount written off other documents -after the application of this document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjWhTaxAmt, 0)) AS AdjgWOAmt FROM APRegister LEFT JOIN APAdjust AS OutgoingApplication ON APRegister.CompanyID = OutgoingApplication.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = OutgoingApplication.AdjgDocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = OutgoingApplication.AdjgRefNbr LEFT JOIN APAdjust AS IncomingApplication ON APRegister.CompanyID = IncomingApplication.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = IncomingApplication.AdjdDocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = IncomingApplication.AdjdRefNbr WHERE APRegister.Released = 1 AND OutgoingApplication.Released = 1 AND IncomingApplication.Released = 1 GROUP BY APRegister.CompanyID, APRegister.DocType, APRegister.RefNbr, APRegister.OrigDocAmt, APRegister.DocBal 

#### Self-Applications 

 In the following cases, the system can create applications of the documents to themselves during the document release process: 

- When the document has a nonzero initial migrated balance 

- When the document combines the information about both the invoice and the corresponding payment 

#### Currency Information 

 A CurrencyInfo record stores details about the currency rate of a given currency relative to the base currency, including how the currency rate has been obtained. The CurrencyInfo DAC can be joined to the DACs of accounts payable entities based on the foreign key CuryInfoID field in the entity DAC. 

 The following query selects currency information references from applications. 

 SELECT -The balance adjustment in the base currency in adjusting documents. APAdjust.AdjAmt, -The balance adjustment of the adjusted document, such as a bill, -in that document's currency. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 15 

 APAdjust.CuryAdjdAmt, -The balance adjustment of the adjusting document, such as a payment, -in that document's currency. APAdjust.CuryAdjgAmt, -The references to the CurrencyInfo records that define the conversion rates -that the system uses to calculate the amounts above. APAdjust.AdjdCuryInfoID, APAdjust.AdjgCuryInfoID, -A reference field to the original CurrencyInfo of the adjusted document. -The value is usually the same as AdjdCuryInfoID, but if the user overrides -the application cross-rate (in APAdjust.AdjdCuryRate), it will be different. APAdjust.AdjdOrigCuryInfoID FROM APAdjust 

#### AP Invoice Lines 

 The APTran DAC contains detail lines about goods and services associated with the revenue. The detail line number is identified by the APTran.LineNbr field. 

 A user can edit the detail lines on the Details tab of the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) and Cash Purchases (AP304000) forms. 

 The following query selects invoices with details. 

 SELECT APRegister.CompanyID, APRegister.DocType, APRegister.RefNbr, APRegister.CuryID, APInvoice.LineTotal, -The total in the base currency can differ from the line total because of rounding. SUM(APTran.TranAmt), APInvoice.CurylineTotal, -The total in the foreign currency must be equal to the line total. SUM(APTran.CuryTranAmt) FROM APRegister INNER JOIN APInvoice ON APRegister.CompanyID = APInvoice.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APInvoice.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APInvoice.RefNbr -You should use a left join because the document may contain no details. LEFT JOIN APTran ON APRegister.CompanyID = APTran.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APTran.TranType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APTran.RefNbr GROUP BY APRegister.CompanyID, APRegister.DocType, APRegister.RefNbr, APRegister.CuryID, APInvoice.LineTotal, APInvoice.CuryLineTotal 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 16 

#### Tax Details 

 The APTax DAC stores auxiliary information about the tax codes and taxable amounts for every corresponding APTran document line. 

 This DAC is not exposed to the user interface and is only used for intermediate tax calculation and traceability. The entities of this type cannot be edited directly. Instead, TaxBaseAttribute descendants aggregate them to the APTaxTran records. APTaxTran is a projection over TaxTran. 

 The TaxTran DAC stores document-level information of all taxes applied to the document. This DAC is shared across Acumatica ERP and used as a centralized source for tax reporting. APTaxTran records can be edited on the Taxes tab of the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) and Cash Purchases (AP304000) forms. 

 The following query shows the calculation of the tax total for an invoice. 

 SELECT SUM(APTax.TaxAmt) FROM APTax WHERE -Corresponds to APInvoice.CompanyID APTax.CompanyID = 2 -Corresponds to APInvoice.DocType AND APTax.TranType = 'INV' -Corresponds to APInvoice.RefNbr AND APTax.RefNbr = '000537' 

#### Discount Details 

 An APInvoiceDiscountDetail record represents a document-level or group-level discount that has been applied to the bill or adjustment. The records of this type are usually created automatically when a user edits document details. However, these discount details can be edited on the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. 

 Line-level discounts do not create discount details and are specified in the line itself in APTran.DiscPct. 

#### Address and Contact Details 

 APPayment references the APAddress and APContact DACs. These DACs store payment-specific remittance address and contact information. The default values of these address and contact are copied from the remittance address and contact referenced by the vendor location selected in the document. However, this data can be overridden by a user and is independent of changes to the original address and contact. The payment-specific address and contact information can be edited on the Remittance tab of the Checks and Payments (AP302000) and Cash Purchases (AP304000) forms. 

 The following query selects the remittance address and contact of payments. 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister INNER JOIN APPayment ON APRegister.CompanyID = APPayment.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = APPayment.DocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APPayment.RefNbr INNER JOIN APAddress ON APPayment.CompanyID = APAddress.CompanyID AND APPayment.RemitAddressID = APAddress.AddressID 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 17 

 INNER JOIN APContact ON APPayment.CompanyID = APContact.CompanyID AND APPayment.RemitContactID = APContact.ContactID 

#### Cash Transactions 

 The creation or removal of an APPayment record in the system always involves the creation or removal of a corresponding cash account transaction ( CATran ). 

 The cash transaction is referenced by the APPayment.CATranID field. All nonzero AP payments must have a reference to a CATran record. The system passes the CATranID value to the general ledger transaction when the payment is released. 

 The following query selects payments with cash account transactions. 

 SELECT * FROM APPayment LEFT JOIN CATran ON APPayment.CompanyID = CATran.CompanyID AND APPayment.CATranID = CATran.TranID 

 The CATran records are updated by the Acumatica ERP functionality (such as general ledger, accounts payable, and accounts receivable) that works with cash accounts. For details about cash transaction DACs, see CA DACs: Transactional Data. 

#### Recurring Transactions 

 The Schedule DAC represents a schedule according to which documents are generated on a regular basis from a template document. The Schedule DAC contains the schedule parameters, such as the schedule type (monthly, weekly, daily, or by the financial period) and frequency. The DAC is used by different Acumatica ERP functional areas. 

 Template AP documents (such as invoices, debit adjustments, and credit adjustments) have the APRegister.Scheduled flag set to 1. Both the template invoice and the generated invoices keep the reference to the schedule in the APRegister.ScheduleID field. 

 A user can edit accounts payable schedules on the Recurring Transactions (AP203500) form. 

#### GL Transactions Generated by the Documents 

 Accounts payable documents generate general ledger transactions upon release, such as the following scenarios: 

- The release of a bill will debit the purchase expense account and credit the accounts payable liability     account. 

- The release of a payment will debit the accounts payable account and credit the cash account specified in     the payment. The following SQL query returns the GL transactions that corresponds to the document. 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister LEFT JOIN GLTran ON APRegister.CompanyID = GLTran.CompanyID AND APRegister.DocType = GLTran.TranType 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 18 

 AND APRegister.RefNbr = GLTran.RefNbr AND GLTran.Module = 'AP' -The referenceID of GLTran stores the ID of the vendor for AP transactions. AND APRegister.VendorID = GLTran.ReferenceID AND APRegister.BatchNbr = GLTran.BatchNbr 

#### GL Transactions Generated by Applications 

 Normally, the application of a check to a bill is an internal accounts payable operation that does not generate general ledger transactions. 

 However, GL transactions are generated when any of the following conditions are met: 

- APAdjust.RGOLAmt <> 0, such as if realized gains or losses exist due to currency rate differences     between the bill and the payment. 

- APAdjust.AdjWHTaxAmt <> 0 OR APAdjust.CuryAdjgWHTaxAmt <> 0 OR     APAdjust.CuryAdjdWHTaxAmt <> 0, such as if withholding tax amounts have been written off the     bill during application. 

- APAdjust.AdjDiscAmt <> 0 OR APAdjust.CuryAdjgDiscAmt <> 0 OR     APAdjust.CuryAdjdDiscAmt <> 0, such as if a cash discount has been taken on the bill during     application. 

- The AP account specified in the adjusted document differs from the AP account specified in the adjusting     document. The following SQL query returns the GL transactions that correspond to the release of applications. 

 SELECT * FROM APRegister LEFT JOIN APAdjust ON APRegister.CompanyID = APAdjust.CompanyID AND ( -Outgoing applications of the document APRegister.DocType = APAdjust.AdjgDocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APAdjust.AdjgRefNbr OR -Incoming applications to the document APRegister.DocType = APAdjust.AdjdDocType AND APRegister.RefNbr = APAdjust.AdjdRefNbr ) LEFT JOIN GLTran ON APAdjust.CompanyID = GLTran.CompanyID AND APAdjust.AdjBatchNbr = GLTran.BatchNbr AND GLTran.Module = 'AP' 

### AP DACs: Historical Data 

 Historical data access classes (DACs) keep historical data on vendors' balance and turnover by financial period. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Payable DACs | 19 

#### APHistory 

 The APHistory DAC keeps the history of vendor operations and the beginning and ending balances in the base currency. The data is aggregated by vendors, branches, AP accounts, AP subaccounts, and financial periods. 

 If a financial period does not have any transactions, the historical record is not created for that period. To get the historical balance for such a period, you need to join the last historical record to the desired period. In reports, you can use BaseAPHistoryByPeriod , which is a projection over APHistory. 

 APHistory must be reconciled with the GL transactions posted from the AP functional area, as shown in the following query. 

 SELECT APHistorySum.CompanyID, APHistorySum.FinPeriodID, APHistorySum.AccountID, APHistorySum.VendorID, APHistorySum.SubID, APHistorySum.Turnover, GLTransactionSum.TotalAmount, IIF(APHistorySum.Turnover + GLTransactionSum.TotalAmount <> 0, 'false', 'true') AS DoesReconcile FROM ( SELECT CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, VendorID, SubID, Turnover = SUM(FinYtdBalance FinBegBalance) FROM APHistory GROUP BY CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, SubID, VendorID ) AS APHistorySum LEFT JOIN ( SELECT CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, ReferenceID, SubID, TotalAmount = SUM(DebitAmt CreditAmt) FROM GLTran WHERE Module = 'AP' GROUP BY CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID,

 SubID, ReferenceID ) AS GLTransactionSum ON APHistorySum.CompanyID = GLTransactionSum.CompanyID AND APHistorySum.FinPeriodID = GLTransactionSum.FinPeriodID AND APHistorySum.AccountID = GLTransactionSum.AccountID AND APHistorySum.VendorID = GLTransactionSum.ReferenceID AND APHistorySum.SubID = GLTransactionSum.SubID 

#### CuryAPHistory 

 The CuryAPHistory DAC keeps the history of vendor operations and the beginning and ending balances in each currency. The data is aggregated by vendors, branches, AP accounts, AP subaccounts, financial periods, and currency ID. 

 If a financial period does not have any transactions, the historical record is not created for that period. To get the historical balance for such a period, you need to join the last historical record before the reported period. In reports, you can use APHistoryByPeriod , which is a projection over CuryAPHistory.

## Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs 

 By using the accounts receivable functionality in Acumatica ERP, you can effectively manage receivables and automate customer billing and payment collection. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in accounts receivable and learn about the relationships between them. 

### AR DACs: General Information 

 The system uses the accounts receivable data access classes (DACs) to enter, monitor, maintain, and process the payments, invoices, and memos that the organization sends to its customers. For details about the AR processes, see Accounts Receivable. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following data: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the DACs of accounts receivable, such as information about     customers, locations, or addresses 

- Transactional data 

- Balance and historical data 

- Data that is related to customer statements 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review the AR DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses accounts receivable data. 

- You need to design a report that uses accounts receivable data. 

- You need to customize the accounts receivable functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project_     _Editor_. 

- You need to customize the accounts receivable functionality by writing customization code. 

#### Basic Relationships Between the AR DACs 

 The following diagram illustrates the main relationships between the accounts receivable DACs. For detailed descriptions of the DACs and DAC fields, look for the needed DAC in the DAC Schema Browser. (For details about the DAC Schema Browser, see Data from Multiple Data Sources: DAC Schema Browser .)

 Figure: Relationships between the AR DACs 

### AR DACs: Reference Data 

 In this topic, you can find information about the data access classes (DACs) that contain reference data that is used in most other DACs in accounts receivable. This data includes customers, locations, and addresses. 

#### Accounts Receivable Preferences 

 The preferences for accounts receivable are available in the ARSetup DAC. An administrative user can edit these preferences on the Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. 

#### Customers 

 The Customers (AR303000) form is used to define any business account that satisfies the following condition: BAccount.Type = CU OR BAccount.Type = VC. (That is, the business account is a customer or both a vendor and a customer.) Business accounts of these types are extended with the information from the Customer DAC, as shown in the following query. 

 SELECT * FROM BAccount INNER JOIN Customer ON BAccount.CompanyID = Customer.CompanyID AND BAccount.BAccountID = Customer.BAccountID 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 23 

 A Customer record contains AR-specific business account data related to customer payment methods, statement cycles, and credit verification rules. 

#### Locations 

 As is true of any other business account, a Customer record can have multiple Location records associated with it. The default customer location is stored in the BAccount.DefLocationID field. 

 The Location DAC contains multiple AR-specific fields whose names start with the C prefix. Examples of these fields are shown in the following table. 

 Field Description 

 CTaxZoneID The default TaxZone associated with the customer location. 

 CSalesAcctID The default sales revenue GL account associated with the location. 

 CARAccountID The default accounts receivable account associated with the location. 

 The tax zones and accounts specified in the Location record can be overridden at the document level. For example, if you specify a particular location in a customer invoice, the tax zone (ARInvoice.TaxZoneID) has the default value copied from Location.CTaxZoneID, but a user can override this value with any other tax zone. 

 Customer locations can be defined on the Customer Locations (AR303020) form. 

#### Addresses and Contacts 

 Three types of addresses and contacts are defined for every customer in the system: 

- The main contact and address, which are specified on the **General** tab of the _Customers_ (AR303000) form.     The main contact and address are referenced by BAccount.DefContactID and     BAccount.DefAddressID fields. 

- The billing contact and address, which are specified on the **Billing** tab of the _Customers_ form.     The billing contact and address are referenced by the Customer.DefBillContactID and     Customer.DefBillAddressID fields, respectively. 

 The billing Address and Contact records serve as templates for the invoice-level bill-to address and contact (which are stored in the ARAddress and ARContact DACs). 

- The default shipping contact and address, which are specified on the **Shipping** tab of the _Customers_ form.     This contact and address are referenced by Location.DefContactID and     Location.DefAddressID of the customer's default location (which is identified by the     BAccount.DefLocationID field). 

 The shipping Address and Contact records serve as templates for the ship-to invoice-level address and contact (ARAddress and ARContact). 

 The selection of the following types of addresses and contacts is illustrated in the queries shown below: 

- Selection of the main customer address and contact 

 SELECT * FROM Customer 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 24 

 INNER JOIN BAccount ON BAccount.CompanyID = Customer.CompanyID AND BAccount.BAccountID = Customer.BAccountID INNER JOIN Contact ON Contact.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID AND Contact.ContactID = BAccount.DefContactID INNER JOIN Address ON Address.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID AND Address.AddressID = BAccount.DefAddressID 

- Selection of the default shipping customer address and contact 

 SELECT * FROM Customer INNER JOIN BAccount ON BAccount.CompanyID = Customer.CompanyID AND BAccount.BAccountID = Customer.BAccountID -Default location INNER JOIN Location ON Location.CompanyID = Customer.CompanyID AND Location.LocationID = BAccount.DefLocationID LEFT JOIN Contact ON Contact.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND Contact.ContactID = Location.DefContactID LEFT JOIN Address ON Address.CompanyID = Location.CompanyID AND Address.AddressID = Location.DefAddressID 

#### Customer Payment Methods 

 The CustomerPaymentMethod and CustomerPaymentMethodDetail DACs store the customer-specific settings of a payment method. The general settings of a payment method are stored in the PaymentMethod DAC, which is defined in cash management. For details on payment methods, see CA DACs: Reference Data. 

 For credit card payment methods, a customer payment method record is required. This record defines all details (that is, CustomerPaymentMethodDetail records) necessary to use the method to record payments (that is, ARPayment records). 

 For generic payment methods (such as cash payment or wire transfer), the presence of a customer-specific payment method record is optional, but it can nevertheless be defined to override the default payment method settings. 

 Customer-specific payment methods are defined on the Customer Payment Methods (AR303010) form. 

#### Discount Codes and Sequences 

 ARDiscount represents an accounts receivable discount code used to define discount sequences (which are stored in DiscountSequence ). The primary function of a discount code is to specify the type of discounts that are based on that code. For example, a document discount can be applicable to only specific customers, or a line discount can be applicable to only specific inventory items. The ARDiscount records are defined on the Discount Codes (AR209000) form. 

 DiscountSequence represents a specific discount based on a discount code. The discount sequence specifies how the discount is calculated based on the amount or quantity of the line item, or on the amount of the document. Discount sequences can be defined on the Discounts (AR209500) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 25 

#### Price Lists 

 The system uses the ARSalesPrice reference DAC to suggest the unit price in document details (that is, in the ARTran.UnitPrice field) that the user inserts into a bill or adjustment. The records store inventory item prices broken down by the following: 

- Price type (which is stored in the PriceType field) 

- Price code (PriceCode), such as specific customer or customer class, depending on the price type 

- Inventory item (InventoryID) 

- Warehouse (SiteID) 

- Currency (CuryID) 

- Unit of measure (UOM) 

- Break quantity (BreakQty) 

- An indicator of whether the price is promotional (IsPromotionalPrice) All these fields form the compound key of customer price records, meaning that they should be unique across the combination of these dimensions. 

 All existing customer prices are defined on the Sales Prices (AR202000) form. However, a user can update an ARSalesPrice record indirectly by creating and releasing AR price worksheets, which are stored in ARPriceWorksheet and are editable on the Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form. The system uses the details of a price worksheet ( ARPriceWorksheetDetail ) to automatically update the ARSalesPrice record once the user releases the worksheet. 

### AR DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that provide transactional data—that is, the DACs that store the accounts receivable documents and related entities. 

#### ARRegister, ARInvoice, and ARPayment 

 All AR documents are stored in the ARRegister DAC. Depending on the type of the document (ARRegister.DocType), the ARRegister DAC is extended by ARInvoice , by ARPayment , or by both DACs. The following table shows how the ARRegister DAC is extended depending on the document type specified on the data entry form. In this table, + indicates that the corresponding record exists for this document type, and indicates that the record does not exist. 

 Document Type ARRegister.DocType 

 Purpose ARRegister ARInvoice ARPayment 

 Invoice INV An invoice for goods and services shipped on credit.

AR documents are defined on the following forms: 

- Most documents that store their data in ARInvoice: The _Invoices and Memos_ (AR301000) form 

- Most documents that store their data in ARPayment: The _Payments and Applications_ (AR302000) form 

- Cash sales and cash returns: The _Cash Sales_ (AR304000) form 

- Credit memos: The _Invoices and Memos_ form, on which the memo is created and released; the _Payments and_     _Applications_ form, on which the memo is applied to payments 

The selection of the following types of documents is illustrated in the queries shown below: 

- Selection of invoices 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr 

- Selection of payments 

 SELECT

- Selection of cash sales and cash returns 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr INNER JOIN ARPayment ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARPayment.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARPayment.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARPayment.RefNbr WHERE -This condition is required because credit memos also have -both the invoice part and the payment part. ARRegister.DocType IN ('CSL', 'VCS')

#### Applications Between Documents 

 An ARAdjust record indicates the application of one AR document to another, which results in an adjustment of both documents' balances. This record contains the foreign key links between two documents, as well as the application amounts and other auxiliary information. 

 In most cases, it is an application of a payment-like document ( ARPayment ) to an invoice-like document ( ARInvoice ), such as when a payment closes an invoice. Sometimes there can also be applications between two payment-like documents (ARPayment), such as when a refund closes a payment. 

 The entities of this type are mainly created and edited on the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. Applications are displayed as details on the Documents to Apply tab. They can also be seen on the Applications tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

 The following SQL query selects released documents with all incoming and outgoing released applications. 

 SELECT ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, -Original document amount ARRegister.OrigDocAmt, -Open document balance ARRegister.DocBal, -Total amount applied to the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjAmt, 0)) AS AdjdAmt, -Total cash discount taken on the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjDiscAmt, 0)) AS AdjdDiscAmt, -Total gain or loss realized on the document SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.RGOLAmt, 0)) AS AdjdRGOLAmt, -Total balance written off the document during application to it SUM(ISNULL(IncomingApplication.AdjWOAmt, 0)) AS AdjdWOAmt, -Total amount applied by the document to other documents SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjAmt, 0)) AS AdjgAmt, -Total cash discount taken on other documents after application of the document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjDiscAmt, 0)) AS AdjgDiscAmt, -Total gain or loss realized on other documents after application of this document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.RGOLAmt, 0)) AS AdjgRGOLAmt, -Total amount written off other documents after application of this document SUM(ISNULL(OutgoingApplication.AdjWOAmt, 0)) AS AdjgWOAmt FROM ARRegister LEFT JOIN ARAdjust AS OutgoingApplication ON ARRegister.CompanyID = OutgoingApplication.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = OutgoingApplication.AdjgDocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = OutgoingApplication.AdjgRefNbr LEFT JOIN ARAdjust AS IncomingApplication ON ARRegister.CompanyID = IncomingApplication.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = IncomingApplication.AdjdDocType 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 30 

 AND ARRegister.RefNbr = IncomingApplication.AdjdRefNbr WHERE ARRegister.Released = 1 AND OutgoingApplication.Released = 1 AND IncomingApplication.Released = 1 GROUP BY ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, ARRegister.OrigDocAmt, ARRegister.DocBal 

#### Self-Applications 

 In the following cases, the system can create applications of the documents to themselves during the document release process: 

- When the document has a nonzero initial migrated balance 

- When the document combines the information about both the invoice and the corresponding payment—     that is, for cash sales and cash returns 

#### Currency Info 

 A CurrencyInfo record stores details about the currency rate of a given currency relative to the base currency, including how the currency rate has been obtained. The CurrencyInfo DAC can be joined to the DACs of accounts receivable entities based on the foreign key CuryInfoID field in the entity DAC. 

 The following query selects currency information references from applications. 

 SELECT -The balance adjustment in the base currency in adjusting documents. ARAdjust.AdjAmt, -The balance adjustment of the adjusted document, such as an invoice, -in that document's currency. ARAdjust.CuryAdjdAmt, -The balance adjustment of the adjusting document, such as a payment, -in that document's currency. ARAdjust.CuryAdjgAmt, -The system calculates the above amounts by using the conversion rates defined -by the CurrencyInfo records, which are referenced by the pair of the following fields. ARAdjust.AdjdCuryInfoID, ARAdjust.AdjgCuryInfoID, -A reference field to the original currency info of the adjusted document. -The value is usually the same as AdjdCuryInfoID, -but if the user overrides the application cross-rate (in ARAdjust.AdjdCuryRate), -it will be different. FROM ARAdjust 

#### Invoice Lines 

 Documents that extend the ARInvoice DAC contain detail lines about goods and services associated with the revenue. They are stored in the ARTran DAC. The detail line number is identified by the ARTran.LineNbr field (which is calculated based on the ARRegister.LineCntr field). 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 31 

 Invoice detail lines can be edited on the Details tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form or the Cash Sales (AR304000) form. 

 The following query selects invoices with details. 

 SELECT ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, ARRegister.CuryID, ARInvoice.LineTotal, -Total in base currency can differ from the line total because of rounding. SUM(ARTran.TranAmt), ARInvoice.CurylineTotal, -Total in foreign currency must be equal to the line total. SUM(ARTran.CuryTranAmt) FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr -You should use left join because the document may contain no details. LEFT JOIN ARTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARTran.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARTran.TranType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARTran.RefNbr GROUP BY ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, ARRegister.CuryID, ARInvoice.LineTotal, ARInvoice.CuryLineTotal 

#### Address and Contact Details 

 ARInvoice references the ARAddress and ARContact DACs. These DACs store invoice-specific bill-to or shipto address and contact information. 

 Aer a Customer record is selected in the document, the default values of the invoice's bill-to address and contact are copied from the billing Address and Contact records, which are referenced by the Customer.DefBillAddressID and Customer.DefBillContactID, respectively. The default values of the invoice's ship-to address and contact are copied from the shipping Address and Contact records that are referenced by the default location (which is specified in Location.DefAddressID and Location.DefContactID). However, this data can be overridden by the user and is independent of changes to the original Address and Contact. 

 The invoice-specific address and contact information can be edited on the Addresses tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form or the Cash Sales (AR304000) form. 

 The address and contact information is printed on the invoice. 

 The selection of the following types of address and contact information is illustrated in the queries shown below: 

- Selection of the bill-to address and contact information about the invoices 

 SELECT * FROM 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 32 

 ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr INNER JOIN ARAddress ON ARInvoice.CompanyID = ARAddress.CompanyID AND ARInvoice.BillAddressID = ARAddress.AddressID INNER JOIN ARContact ON ARInvoice.CompanyID = ARContact.CompanyID AND ARInvoice.BillContactID = ARContact.ContactID 

- Selection of the ship-to address and contact information about the invoices 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr INNER JOIN ARAddress ON ARInvoice.CompanyID = ARAddress.CompanyID AND ARInvoice.ShipAddressID = ARAddress.AddressID INNER JOIN ARContact ON ARInvoice.CompanyID = ARContact.CompanyID AND ARInvoice.ShipContactID = ARContact.ContactID 

#### Tax Details 

 An ARTax record stores auxiliary information about the tax code and taxable amounts for every corresponding ARTran document line. 

 The ARTax DAC is not exposed to the user interface and is only used for intermediate tax calculation and traceability. The entities of this type cannot be edited directly. Instead, TaxBaseAttribute descendants aggregate them to ARTaxTran records. ARTaxTran is a projection over TaxTran. 

 The TaxTran DAC stores document-level information of all taxes applied to the document. This DAC is shared across Acumatica ERP and used as a centralized source for tax reporting. ARTaxTran records can be edited on the Taxes tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) or Cash Sales (AR304000) form. 

 The following query obtains invoice tax totals. 

 SELECT ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, ARRegister.CuryID, -The amount in the base currency ARInvoice.TaxTotal, -The additional tax matches the document tax total SUM (CASE WHEN Tax.TaxCalcLevel = 0 THEN 0 ELSE TaxTran.TaxAmt END) AS AdditionalTax, 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 33 

 -The inclusive tax is not included in the tax total SUM (CASE WHEN Tax.TaxCalcLevel = 0 THEN TaxTran.TaxAmt ELSE 0 END) AS InclusiveTax, -The amount in the currency of the document ARInvoice.CuryTaxTotal, -The additional tax matches the document tax total SUM (CASE WHEN Tax.TaxCalcLevel = 0 THEN 0 ELSE TaxTran.CuryTaxAmt END) AS CurrencyAdditionalTax, -The inclusive tax is not included in the tax total SUM (CASE WHEN Tax.TaxCalcLevel = 0 THEN TaxTran.CuryTaxAmt ELSE 0 END) AS CurrencyInclusiveTax FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr LEFT JOIN TaxTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = TaxTran.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = TaxTran.TranType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = TaxTran.RefNbr AND TaxTran.Module = 'AR' LEFT JOIN Tax ON TaxTran.CompanyID = Tax.CompanyID AND TaxTran.TaxID = Tax.TaxID GROUP BY ARRegister.CompanyID, ARRegister.DocType, ARRegister.RefNbr, ARRegister.CuryID, ARInvoice.TaxTotal, ARInvoice.CuryTaxTotal 

#### Salesperson Commissions 

 The ARSalesPerTran DAC stores information on the salesperson commission basis and the commission calculated on the document for each associated salesperson. 

 The system creates records of this type automatically when a user specifies a salesperson ID in an invoice line on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. (Invoice lines are stored in ARTran .) 

 You should use LEFT JOIN to obtain salespeople commissions associated with invoices, as shown in the following query, because documents can contain no commission. 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 34 

 INNER JOIN ARInvoice ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARInvoice.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARInvoice.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARInvoice.RefNbr LEFT JOIN ARSalesPerTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARSalesPerTran.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARSalesPerTran.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARSalesPerTran.RefNbr 

 Salesperson commissions can be calculated either on the invoice basic or on the payment basis. If a commission is based on payments, every payment records the paid portion of each original line. The following query obtains the salesperson commissions calculated on payments. 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARPayment ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARPayment.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARPayment.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARPayment.RefNbr LEFT JOIN ARSalesPerTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARSalesPerTran.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARSalesPerTran.AdjdDocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARSalesPerTran.AdjdRefNbr 

#### Discount Details 

 The ARInvoiceDiscountDetail records represent a documentor group-level discount that has been applied to the invoice or memo. The records of this type are created automatically when the user edits document details and are based on the applicable discount sequences. However, all discount details can then be edited manually on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 

 Line-level discounts do not create discount details and are specified in the line itself in ARTran.DiscPct. 

#### Cash Transactions 

 The creation or removal of an ARPayment record in the system always involves the creation or removal of a corresponding cash account transaction ( CATran ). 

 The cash account transaction is referenced by the ARPayment.CATranID field. All nonzero AR payments must have a reference to a CATran record. The CATranID value is passed to the general ledger transaction upon payment release. The following query selects payments with cash account transactions. 

 SELECT * FROM ARPayment LEFT JOIN CATran ON ARPayment.CompanyID = CATran.CompanyID AND ARPayment.CATranID = CATran.TranID 

 The CATran records are updated by the Acumatica ERP functionality that works with cash accounts, such as general ledger, accounts payable, and accounts receivable. For details about cash transaction DACs, see CA DACs: Transactional Data. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 35 

#### Credit Card Processing Transactions 

 The ARPayment documents that have a credit card payment method referenced by their ARPayment.PaymentMethodID field can have associated credit card processing entities, such as credit card processing transactions (which are stored in CCProcTran ). 

 You can obtain the credit card processing transactions of a payment by the following query. 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister INNER JOIN ARPayment ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARPayment.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = ARPayment.DocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARPayment.RefNbr LEFT JOIN CCProcTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = CCProcTran.CompanyID AND (ARRegister.DocType = CCProcTran.TranType OR ARRegister.DocType IN ('REF', 'RCS')) AND ARRegister.RefNbr = CCProcTran.RefNbr 

 Credit card processing transactions are visible on the Card Processing tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form or the Cash Sales (AR304000) form. 

#### Linked SO Orders 

 On the Sales Orders tab of the Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, a user can link sales orders (which are stored in SOOrder ) to the payment. These links are stored as SOAdjust records. The purpose of these links is to reserve part of the payment's balance and automatically apply its payment to the AR invoice generated from the order once the order has been billed. 

#### Recurring Transactions 

 The Schedule DAC represents a schedule according to which documents are generated on a regular basis from a template document. The Schedule DAC contains the schedule parameters, such as the schedule type (monthly, weekly, daily, or by the financial period) and frequency. The DAC is used by different Acumatica ERP functional areas. 

 Template AR documents (such as invoices) have ARRegister.Scheduled set to 1. Both the template document and the generated documents keep the reference to the schedule in the ARRegister.ScheduleID field. 

 A user can edit accounts receivable schedules on the Recurring Transactions (AR203500) form. 

#### Transactions Generated by Documents 

 Accounts receivable documents generate general ledger transactions upon release, such as the following scenarios: 

- The release of an invoice will credit the sales revenue account and debit the accounts receivable asset     account. 

- The release of a payment will credit the accounts receivable account and debit the cash account specified in     the payment. The following SQL query will return the GL transactions that correspond to the document. 

 SELECT * 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 36 

 FROM ARRegister LEFT JOIN GLTran ON ARRegister.CompanyID = GLTran.CompanyID AND ARRegister.DocType = GLTran.TranType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = GLTran.RefNbr AND GLTran.Module = 'AR' -The ReferenceID of GLTran stores the ID of the customer for AR transactions AND ARRegister.CustomerID = GLTran.ReferenceID AND ARRegister.BatchNbr = GLTran.BatchNbr 

#### GL Transactions Generated by Applications 

 Normally, the application of a payment to an invoice is an internal AR operation that affects the customer balances but does not generate general ledger transactions. 

 However, GL transactions are generated when any of the following conditions are met: 

- ARAdjust.RGOLAmt <> 0, such as if realized gains or losses exist due to currency rate differences     between the invoice and the payment. 

- ARAdjust.AdjWOAmt <> 0 OR ARAdjust.CuryAdjgWOAmt <> 0 OR     ARAdjust.CuryAdjdWOAmt <> 0, such as if amounts have been written off the invoice during     application. 

- ARAdjust.AdjDiscAmt <> 0 OR ARAdjust.CuryAdjgDiscAmt <> 0 OR     ARAdjust.CuryAdjdDiscAmt <> 0, such as if a cash discount has been taken on the invoice during     application. 

- The AR account specified in the adjusting document differs from the AR account specified in the adjusted     document. (The AR account is specified in ARRegister.ARAccountID.) 

- The AR subaccount specified in the adjusting document differs from the AR subaccount specified in the     adjusted document (The AR subaccount is specified in ARRegister.ARSubID.) 

- The branch specified in the adjusting document differs from the branch specified in the adjusted document     (The branch is specified in ARRegister.BranchID.) The following SQL query returns the GL transactions that correspond to the release of applications. 

 SELECT * FROM ARRegister LEFT JOIN ARAdjust ON ARRegister.CompanyID = ARAdjust.CompanyID AND ( -Outgoing applications of the document ARRegister.DocType = ARAdjust.AdjgDocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARAdjust.AdjgRefNbr OR -Incoming applications to the document ARRegister.DocType = ARAdjust.AdjdDocType AND ARRegister.RefNbr = ARAdjust.AdjdRefNbr ) LEFT JOIN GLTran ON ARAdjust.CompanyID = GLTran.CompanyID AND ARAdjust.AdjBatchNbr = GLTran.BatchNbr AND GLTran.Module = 'AR'

### AR DACs: Balance and Historical Data 

 The system stores information about the customer balance in balance data access classes (DACs). Historical DACs keep historical data on customers' balance and turnover by financial period. 

#### ARBalances 

 The ARBalances DAC stores the information on current customer balances, including unreleased documents and open customer orders. The DAC is used for credit limit verification and quick customer balance lookup. All data is stored in the base currency of the customer location. 

#### ARHistory 

 The ARHistory DAC keeps the history of customer operations and the beginning and ending balances in the base currency. 

 The DAC accumulates a number of important year-to-date and period-to-date amounts (such as sales, debit and credit adjustments, and gains and losses). The history is accumulated across the following dimensions: branch, GL account, GL subaccount, financial period, and customer. History records are created and updated during the document release process. Various projections over ARHistory are used in AR inquiry forms and reports, such as Customer Summary (AR401000). 

 If a financial period does not have any transactions, the historical record is not created for that period. To get the historical balance for such a period, you need to join the last historical record to the desired period. In reports, this is done with BaseARHistoryByPeriod , which is a projection over ARHistory. 

 ARHistory records must be reconciled with the GL transactions posted from AR, as shown in the following query. 

 SELECT ARHistorySum.CompanyID, ARHistorySum.FinPeriodID, ARHistorySum.AccountID, ARHistorySum.CustomerID, ARHistorySum.SubID, ARHistorySum.Turnover, GLTransactionSum.TotalAmount, (IIF(ARHistorySum.Turnover <> GLTransactionSum.TotalAmount, 'N', 'Y')) AS DoesReconcile FROM ( SELECT CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, CustomerID, SubID, Turnover = SUM(FinYtdBalance FinBegBalance) FROM ARHistory GROUP BY CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, SubID, CustomerID 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 38 

 ) AS ARHistorySum LEFT JOIN ( SELECT CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, ReferenceID, SubID, TotalAmount = SUM(DebitAmt CreditAmt) FROM GLTran WHERE Module = 'AR' GROUP BY CompanyID, FinPeriodID, AccountID, SubID, ReferenceID ) AS GLTransactionSum ON ARHistorySum.CompanyID = GLTransactionSum.CompanyID AND ARHistorySum.FinPeriodID = GLTransactionSum.FinPeriodID AND ARHistorySum.AccountID = GLTransactionSum.AccountID AND ARHistorySum.CustomerID = GLTransactionSum.ReferenceID AND ARHistorySum.SubID = GLTransactionSum.SubID 

#### CuryARHistory 

 The CuryARHistory DACs keep the history of customer operations and the beginning and ending balances in each currency. Data is accumulated across the currency ID dimension and the same dimensions as are used in the ARHistory DAC. 

 If a financial period does not have any transactions, the historical record is not created for that period. To get the historical balance for such period, you need to join the last historical record before the reported period. In reports, this is done with ARHistoryByPeriod , which is a projection over CuryARHistory. 

#### Customer Balance Validation 

 Rarely (such as because of manually executed SQL scripts), the database may contain discrepancies between customer historical balances (which are stored in the ARBalances and ARHistory DACs) and real document balances. To fix these inconsistencies, a user can run the recalculation process on the Recalculate Customer Balances (AR509900) form, which recalculates customer historical balances, document balances (in ARRegister.CuryDocBal and ARRegister.DocBal), and multiple other service fields (such as ARRegister.Status, ARRegister.OpenDoc, ARRegister.ClosedTranPeriodID, and ARRegister.ClosedFinPeriodID). During this process, the system emulates the release process for all selected documents and its applications but without affecting the general ledger. 

 For document applications, the system can restore the release process history by using the ARRegister.AdjCntr and ARAdjust.AdnNbr fields as follows: 

1. Set ARRegister.AdjCntr to _0_. 

2. Select all applications with this value. 

3. Increment the counter value. 

4. Repeat the same steps while ARRegister.AdjCntr is less than the original counter value. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 39 

 All selected documents and applications are processed in the same order as they have been released in the past. 

### AR DACs: Customer Statements 

 By using the customer statement functionality, users can send statements to customers. Each statement shows the open balance (due or overdue) detailed by reference data about either of the following, depending on the statement type of the applicable customer on the Customers (AR303000) form: 

- Current open documents (for the _Open Item_ statement type) 

- All document activity since the last statement (for the _Balance Brought Forward_ statement type) 

#### ARStatementCycle 

 To facilitate statement processing, each Customer record in the system is assigned to a statement cycle (which is stored in ARStatementCycle ), as the following SQL query shows. 

 SELECT ARStatementCycle.StatementCycleID, BAccount.AcctCD, ARStatementCycle.*, BAccount.*, Customer.* FROM ARStatementCycle INNER JOIN Customer ON Customer.CompanyID = ARStatementCycle.CompanyID AND Customer.StatementCycleId = ARStatementCycle.StatementCycleId INNER JOIN BAccount ON Customer.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID AND Customer.BAccountID = BAccount.BAccountID 

 The statement cycle defines the general settings for the processing of statements and overdue charges, including the following: 

- The boundaries and names of the aging periods of documents 

- The schedule type for statement processing, such as monthly, weekly, or by a financial period The type of statements ( _Open Item_ or _Balance Brought Forward_ ) is generated for a particular customer and is indicated by Customer.StatementType. 

#### Statements, Details, and Applications 

 The primary entity representing a customer statement in the system is ARStatement. It contains general statement information (including aged customer due and overdue balances on the statement date) and serves as a master entity for all document details that are displayed in the statement. Document details are stored in ARStatementDetail. 

 The following query obtains the last customer statement with details. 

 SELECT * FROM Customer INNER JOIN BAccount ON Customer.CompanyID = BAccount.CompanyID 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Accounts Receivable DACs | 40 

 AND Customer.BAccountID = BAccount.BAccountID LEFT JOIN ARStatement ON ARStatement.CompanyID = Customer.CompanyID AND ARStatement.CustomerID = Customer.BAccountID AND ARStatement.StatementDate = Customer.StatementLastDate LEFT JOIN ARStatementDetail ON ARStatementDetail.CompanyID = ARStatement.CompanyID AND ARStatementDetail.CustomerID = ARStatement.CustomerID AND ARStatementDetail.StatementDate = ARStatement.StatementDate AND ARStatementDetail.CuryID = ARStatement.CuryID 

During statement processing for a customer on a given date, a separate ARStatement record is created for every combination of branch and currency used in relevant customer documents. 

However, in reports, statements are displayed as follows: 

- Statements with different ARStatement.CuryID are consolidated for displaying if     Customer.PrintCuryStatements = 0. 

- Statements with different ARStatement.BranchID are consolidated for displaying if     ARSetup.ConsolidatedStatement = 1. 

In addition, if customers are in a parent-child relationship, you can consolidate child statements under the parent customer for displaying by using the following condition: BAccount.ParentBAccountID IS NOT NULL AND Customer.ConsolidateStatements = 1. However, separate statements are always prepared for each individual customer in the family.

 Figure: Relationships between CA DACs 

### CA DACs: Reference Data 

 In this topic, you can find information about the data access classes (DACs) that contain reference data that is used in most of the DACs in cash management. 

#### Cash Management Setup 

 The following DACs are used for the configuration of the cash management functionality: 

- _CASetup_ : Stores the general settings of cash management. A user can edit these preferences on the _Cash_     _Management Preferences_ (CA101000) form. 

- _CASetupApproval_ : Stores the map of persons that approve documents in cash management. The map     contains a reference to the _EPAssignmentMap_ DAC. 

- _CAEntryType_ : Stores the list of entry types that can be used in cash management. 

#### Reference DACs 

 The following table lists the reference DACs. 

 DAC Description 

 CABankTranRule Represents the rule that can be applied to CABankTran in order to automatically create a cash transaction for that bank transaction. 

 CashAccount Stores the details and settings of cash accounts. 

 CashAccountCheck Maintains the numbers of already printed check forms to avoid duplication of the used numbers. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Cash Management DACs | 43 

 DAC Description 

 CashAccountETDetail Defines the settings for deposit to the cash account from the clearing account or accounts. When this record is defined for the specific cash account–deposit account pair, users can post to the cash account from the specific clearing account. 

 CashAccountPaymentMethodDetail 

 Links the CashAccount and PaymentMethodDetail DACs, and stores additional settings for a pair of a cash account and an entry type. 

 PaymentMethod Holds the settings of the payment method. 

 PaymentMethodAccount Links the CashAccount and PaymentMethod DACs and stores additional settings for a pair of a cash account and a payment method. 

 PaymentMethodDetail Stores the additional settings that are required to use the payment method. 

### CA DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of data access classes (DACs) that store transactional data, such as the data of the cash management documents. 

#### CATran 

 The CATran DAC stores all cash accounting transactions. It can contain cash transactions originated from cash management and other functional areas, such as accounts payable and accounts receivable. 

 Almost all CA forms use the CATran DAC for creating, processing, or viewing records. 

#### Transactions 

 On the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form, you can directly enter cash transactions and view or edit the details of existing ones. This form works with the DACs listed in the following table. 

 DAC Description 

 CAAdj Contains manual transactions created in cash management. After the data is saved on a cash management form, the data is also saved in the CATran DAC. 

 CASplit Is used for storing the details of cash accounting transactions, and includes the accounting data of a transaction, such as the account and subaccount. 

 CATax Stores tax details of cash transactions. 

 The following example shows the selection of a record for the Cash Transactions form. (In this example, @CompanyID, @TranType, and @RefNbr are the values that are passed as parameters to the request.) 

 SELECT * FROM CAAdj INNER JOIN CATran 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Cash Management DACs | 44 

 ON CAAdj.CompanyID=CATran.CompanyID AND CAAdj.TranID=CATran.TranID LEFT JOIN CASplit ON CASplit.CompanyID=CAAdj.CompanyID AND CASplit.AdjTranType=CAAdj.AdjTranType AND CASplit.AdjRefNbr=CAAdj.AdjRefNbr WHERE CAAdj.CompanyID=@CompanyID AND CAAdj.AdjTranType=@TranType AND CAAdj.AdjRefNbr=@RefNbr 

#### Bank Transactions 

 With Acumatica ERP, you can import transactions in various formats into the system and process these transactions further to ease the reconciliation process. 

 Bank transactions are processed in one of the following ways: 

- The transaction is marked as hidden (that is, the Hidden field is set to true). Such transactions will be     excluded from the process of matching transactions. 

- The transaction is matched to an existing payment in the system. 

- The transaction is matched to an existing invoice in the system. 

- A new document for the bank transaction is added. For details about bank transactions, see _Managing Bank Statements_. 

 The following table lists the DACs related to bank transactions. 

 DAC Description 

 CABankTranHeader Stores the headers of bank statements by account. The records of this type are defined on the Import Bank Transactions (CA306500) form. 

 CABankTran Сontains transactions imported from the bank statement. The following forms are related to this DAC: Process Bank Transactions (CA306000), Import Bank Transactions , and Bank Transactions History (CA402000). 

 CABankTranAdjustment Represents the adjustments to accounts payable or accounts receivable documents and provides links between adjusted documents and bank transactions. 

 The CABankTranAdjustment DAC contains the records for the bank transactions for which new AR or AP documents are added on the Create Payment tab of the Process Bank Transactions form when the transactions are processed. However, these records exist only during the creation of documents. When processing is finished, all related CABankTranAdjustment records are removed. 

 The values of the fields of the CABankTranAdjustment record are copied to the corresponding fields of the created ARAdjust or APAdjust record. 

 CABankTranDetail Represents a CA transaction detail for the bank transaction for which a CA document will be created. 

 The values from CABankTranDetail are copied to CASplit , which is created during the bank transaction processing.

 Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs | 51 

## Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs 

 The primary purpose of the deferred revenue (DR) functionality in Acumatica ERP is the creation and recognition of deferred revenue and expense transactions. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in deferred revenue and learn about the relationships between them. 

### DR DACs: General Information 

 Deferred revenue is money that the company receives in advance for products and services that will be delivered or performed later. This means that the revenue amount cannot be recognized in the current financial period because it has not yet been earned. Instead, in the financial period of the delivery, the deferred amount is recognized as revenue. 

 You may also need to use deferred expenses, which are costs that have already been incurred, even though the products have not been used or consumed or the services have not been delivered. For example, suppose that your company pays upfront for a five-year insurance policy. It would not be correct to recognize the whole expense in a single period. Instead, you spread the expenses over five years, recognizing part of the amount each month. 

 The system uses the deferred revenue data access classes (DACs), most of which have the DR prefix, to give users the ability to view and edit deferral schedules that have been generated for accounts payable and accounts receivable documents. The portions of deferred amount are recognized according to these schedules. For details about the deferred revenue processes, see Deferred Revenue. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following information: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the DACs of deferred revenue 

- Transactional data 

- Balance data 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review deferred revenue DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses deferred revenue data. 

- You need to design a report that uses deferred revenue data. 

- You need to customize the deferred revenue functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project Editor_. 

- You need to customize the deferred revenue functionality by writing customization code.

#### Deferred Revenue Entities and Processes 

 In Acumatica ERP, revenue recognition schedules are associated with individual invoice lines (which are stored as records in the ARTran DAC). The association is performed automatically upon release if the user specifies a deferral code (that is, a record in the DRDeferredCode DAC) in the line. 

 For example, suppose that a user has created and released an AR invoice (a record in the ARInvoice DAC) with three document lines (ARTran records), which are the following: 

- Line 1 corresponds to a product delivered in the current financial period. The document line does not have a     deferral code specified. 

- Line 2 corresponds to a six-month insurance contract. It contains a deferral code that specifies six     recognition occurrences. 

- Line 3 corresponds to a five-year long-term contract that begins in three months. It contains another     deferral code with 60 recognition occurrences and a recognition offset of three periods. The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) is a set of accounting principles documented by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. According to ASC 605, the revenue recognition schedules for the AR invoice in this example will be created as follows: 

- Line 1 will not have a revenue recognition schedule created. During release of the AR invoice, the system will     directly post the line amount onto the sales income account. 

- For lines 2 and 3, the system will post the line amount to the deferred revenue account specified in     DRDeferredCode.Account and create two different recognition schedules according to the rules     determined by the deferral codes of the respective lines. For the differences for ASC 606, see the _Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606_ section below. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs | 53 

#### Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606 

 International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was introduced by the International Accounting Standards Board to provide a comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. A user can switch on revenue recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606 if the user enables the Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606 feature on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. 

 ASC 606 mode affects only deferred revenue (which originates from AR and SO documents) and does not change deferred expenses (which originate from AP documents). 

 Revenue recognition schedules are associated with all invoice lines ( ARTran records) with deferral code ( DRDeferredCode records) in the lines. 

 For example, suppose that a user has created and released a sales invoice (an ARInvoice record) with three document lines (ARTran records), which are the following: 

- Line 1 corresponds to a product delivered in the current financial period. The document line does not have a     deferral code specified. 

- Line 2 corresponds to a six-month insurance contract. It contains a deferral code that specifies six     recognition occurrences. 

- Line 3 corresponds to a five-year long-term contract beginning in three months. It contains another deferral     code with 60 recognition occurrences and a recognition offset of three periods. As a result, the revenue recognition schedules for the AR invoice in this example will be created as follows: 

- Line 1 will not have a revenue recognition schedule created. During release of the AR invoice, the system will     directly post the line amount onto the sales income account. 

- For lines 2 and 3, the system will post the line amounts to deferred revenue accounts specified in     DRDeferredCode.Account and create one recognition schedule with two revenue components from     line 2 and line 3. 

#### Basic Relationships Between Deferred Revenue DACs 

 The following diagram illustrates the main relationships between deferred revenue DACs. For detailed descriptions of the DACs and DAC fields, look for the needed DAC in the DAC Schema Browser. (For details about the DAC Schema Browser, see Data from Multiple Data Sources: DAC Schema Browser .)

### DR DACs: Reference Data 

 In this topic, you can find information about the data access classes (DACs) that contain reference data that is used in most of the DACs in deferred revenue functionality. 

#### Deferred Revenue Preferences 

 The preferences for the deferred revenue documents are stored in the DRSetup DAC. A user can edit these preferences on the Deferred Revenue Preferences (DR101000) form. 

#### Deferred Codes 

 A deferral code (which is represented by a DRDeferredCode record) is a basic entity of Acumatica ERP deferred revenue functionality. The deferral code determines multiple aspects of how revenue should be recognized, such as the following: 

- How the full deferred amount should be distributed between recognition transactions (which is specified in     the Method field) 

- Onto which liability account (the AccountID field) and subaccount (the SubID field) the deferred amount     should be posted upon document line release 

- What percentage of revenue (the ReconNowPct field) should be recognized immediately upon document     line release and posted to the relevant income account 

- How many financial periods should pass (the StartOffset field) between the document line release and     the moment of first revenue recognition 

- How many times (the Occurrences field) the revenue should be recognized for the full deferral amount to     transfer from the deferred revenue account to the income account 

- How oen (Frequency) the revenue should be recognized 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs | 55 

 A user can specify a deferred code in the document line (that is, in an ARTran record), which indicates that the sales amount associated with the line should not be posted directly to the income account upon release. Instead, it will be deferred and then recognized according to the schedule and rules defined by the deferral code. 

### DR DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of the DACs that provide transactional data. 

#### Revenue Recognition Schedules 

 A user can specify a deferral code in the document line (that is, in a ARTran or APTran record), which indicates that the sales amount associated with the line should not be posted directly to the account when the invoice or bill is released. Instead, it will be deferred and then recognized according to the schedule and the rules defined by the deferral code. 

 Revenue recognition schedules in Acumatica ERP are stored at the following levels: 

- Summary data: In the _DRSchedule_ DAC 

- Inventory item data: In the _DRScheduleDetail_ DAC 

- Deferral or recognition transaction data: In the _DRScheduleTran_ DAC Schedule components (DRScheduleDetail records) logically correspond to the recognition components of an inventory item ( _INComponent_ ). However, if the item is not a multiple-deliverable arrangement, it has no INComponent records, and its only revenue component is the item itself ( _InventoryItem_ ). 

#### DRSchedule 

 A DRSchedule record represents a revenue recognition schedule, which is also called deferral schedule. The primary purpose of a DRSchedule record is to link the associated deferral components (which are stored in the DRScheduleDetail DAC) and their transactions (which are stored in the DRScheduleTran DAC) with the original invoice line (which is stored in the ARTran or APTran DAC). 

 A deferral schedule is usually created automatically upon release of an invoice with document line that have a deferral code specified (in the DeferredCode field of the ARTran or APTran DAC). However, a user can also create a custom deferral schedule directly on the Deferral Schedule (DR201500) form. Therefore, the connection between ARTran or APTran and DRSchedule is optional. For details about custom schedules, see Custom Schedules. 

#### DRScheduleDetail 

 A schedule can have any number of components, which are stored in the DRScheduleDetail DAC. The DAC has the following key fields: 

- ScheduleID: A reference to the parent deferral schedule. 

- ComponentID: A reference to the inventory item or item component from the original document line in     _ARTran_ or _APTran_. If a line does not have an inventory item associated with it, its corresponding schedule     component will also have an empty ComponentID. 

- DetailLineNbr: An additional key that is necessary because a deferral schedule in ASC 606 mode can     have multiple lines with the same ComponentID. Additionally, the DAC has the following fields to hold amounts: 

- TotalAmt: The total amount of revenue associated with the component. 

- DefTotal: The total deferred amount to be recognized by recognition transactions (which are stored in     the _DRScheduleTran_ DAC) associated with the component. This amount is equal to TotalAmt or _0_ if the     component is a residual multiple deliverable arrangement (MDA) component. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs | 56 

- DefAmt: The remaining deferred amount to be recognized by recognition transactions. Initially, the     amount is equal to DefTotal. The amount is decreased aer the posting of each individual recognition     transaction (which is stored in the DRScheduleTran record) associated with the component. For the deferral components that belong to the same schedule, the sum of the amounts in the TotalAmt field is always equal to the DRSchedule.OrigLineAmt amount. 

 The DefCodeID field carries over the reference to the deferral code (which is stored in the DRDeferredCode DAC) from the original invoice line (which is stored in the ARTran DAC) and defines the recognition schedule structure for the component's recognition transactions. 

 Typically, in ASC 605 mode, a deferral schedule will have only one DRScheduleDetail, with its ComponentID field equal to ARTran.InventoryID of the original document line. However, it can have multiple components in the following cases: 

- When additional DRScheduleDetail components are added manually by the user to a custom deferral     schedule. For details about custom schedules, see _Custom Schedules_. 

- When the original document line (which is stored in the ARTran DAC) references a MDA deferral code and a     bundle inventory item. Similarly, in ASC 606 mode, a user can manually override DRScheduleDetail components. In this case, each original document line with a multiple deliverable arrangement deferral code can create multiple DRScheduleDetail components. 

 The components have one of the following statuses: 

- _Dra_ : The component can be edited or deleted. Its transactions (which are stored in the DRScheduleTran     DAC) can be added, edited, or deleted, but they cannot be recognized. 

- _Open_ : The component is read-only. Its unrecognized transactions can be added, edited, or deleted. Its     recognized transactions are read-only. 

- _Closed_ : The component is read-only. All of its transactions are recognized and cannot be added, modified, or     deleted. 

#### DRScheduleTran 

 Semantically, there are two main types of deferred revenue transactions (which are stored in DRScheduleTran ) in Acumatica ERP: deferral transactions and recognition transactions. 

 For non-dra schedules, both types of transactions are created automatically upon the release of the invoice line (that is, ARTran or APTran record). The process differs slightly for dra schedules (including custom schedules), as described in Draft Deferral Schedules and Custom Schedules. 

#### Dra Deferral Schedules 

 The system creates a dra deferral schedule when a user clicks View Deferrals on the toolbar of the Details tab of the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form aer selecting an invoice line on the tab. 

 By using dra schedules, before the release of the source document, the user can edit the deferred revenue components and transactions, such as change amounts, or the number of transactions that are automatically defined by the deferral code. 

 Dra schedules differ from non-dra deferral schedules (which are created by the system upon document release) in the following key regards: 

- The DRSchedule.IsDraft field of the dra schedule is set to true upon creation. 

- The dra schedule components (which are stored in _DRScheduleDetail_ ) are created with     DRScheduleDetail.Status set to the value of DRScheduleStatus.Draft. 

- The dra schedule components are created automatically depending on the deferral code (which is stored     in ARTran.DeferredCode or APTran.DeferredCode) and inventory item (which is stored in 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Deferred Revenue DACs | 57 

 ARTran.InventoryID or APTran.InventoryID) of the invoice line. However, the user can edit the set of these components. 

- The components cannot be released manually from the _Deferral Schedule_ (DR201500) or _Release Schedules_     (DR503000) form. 

- All schedule components are released automatically when the source invoice line (which is stored in     ARTran or APTran) is released. 

#### Custom Schedules 

 A custom schedule is created when a user manually adds a schedule on the Deferral Schedule (DR201500) form. By using a custom schedule, a user can attach deferral schedules to the lines of documents that have already been released. 

 Custom schedules differ from non-custom deferral schedules in the following regards: 

- Both DRSchedule.IsDraft and DRSchedule.IsCustom are set to true when a custom schedule is     created. 

- A user can edit a custom schedule ( _DRSchedule_ ) on the _Deferral Schedule_ form. 

- The set of schedule components and recognition transactions of a custom schedule is completely     determined by the user on the _Deferral Schedule_ form, regardless of the deferral code in a document line. 

- The user can manually release custom schedule components ( _DRScheduleDetail_ ) on the _Deferral_     _Schedule_ (DR201500) or _Release Schedules_ (DR503000) form. 

- Because the referenced document line (if any) has already been released, no credit line deferral transaction     is created for the custom schedule. 

### DR DACs: Balance Data 

 DRRevenueBalance and DRRevenueProjection are report DACs that are designed to store the deferred revenue recognition balances and the actual and projected recognition amounts. DRRevenueBalance stores balances and amounts for the deferred revenue account. DRRevenueProjection accumulates amounts for the sales revenue account. The balances of both DACs are updated simultaneously upon the creation, update, and recognition of any deferred revenue transactions. 

 The system uses both DACs for displaying deferred revenue reports. The DACs have the following dimensions by which the balances are tracked: 

- Branch 

- Account 

- Subaccount 

- Customer 

- Inventory item or item component 

- Project 

- Financial period Similarly, the _DRExpenseBalance_ DAC stores the deferred expense recognition balances, and the _DRExpenseProjection_ DAC stores the actual and projected recognition amounts.

## Reviewing General Ledger DACs 

 The general ledger is the central functional area of Acumatica ERP, working seamlessly with other parts of the system and giving instant access to mission-critical financial data. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in the general ledger and learn about the relationships between them. 

### GL DACs: General Information 

 The system uses the general ledger data access classes (DACs) to collect all financial information to be analyzed, summarized, and reported upon. For details about the general ledger processes, see General Ledger. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following data: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the DACs of general ledger 

- Transactional data 

- Historical data 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review GL DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses general ledger data. 

- You need to design a report that uses general ledger data. 

- You need to customize the general ledger functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project Editor_. 

- You need to customize the general ledger functionality by writing customization code. 

#### Basic Relationships Between GL DACs 

 The following diagram shows the basic general ledger DACs and the relationships between them. For detailed descriptions of the DACs and DAC fields, look for the needed DAC in the DAC Schema Browser. (For details about the DAC Schema Browser, see Data from Multiple Data Sources: DAC Schema Browser .) 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 59 

 Figure: Relationships between GL DACs 

### GL DACs: Reference Data 

 Reference data access classes (DACs) contain the data, such as branches and accounts, that is used in most of the DACs in general ledger. 

#### General Ledger Preferences 

 The general preferences for the general ledger are stored in the GLSetup DAC. These settings include numbering sequences for general ledger batches, document and payment processing options, mailing settings, and special accounts that are used in the general ledger. 

 The basic configuration of the general ledger is stored in the FinYearSetup and AccountClass tables. 

 The FinYearSetup DAC stores the financial year setup record, which is used to define the template for the actual financial years. Template financial periods of the year are stored in the FinPeriodSetup DAC. Financial year and financial period templates are configured on the Financial Year (GL101000) form. 

 The AccountClass DAC stores account classes, which are used for the grouping, sorting, and filtering of information associated with general ledger accounts in reports and inquiries. Account classes are edited on the Account Classes (GL202000) form. 

#### Reference Data 

 The following table lists the reference DACs. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 60 

**DAC Description** 

_BranchAcctMap_ Specifies the rules for balancing inter-branch transactions. 

_Branch_ Holds general information about each branch of a company, including the identifier, name, address, default location, and employees. 

_Ledger_ Stores the accounting ledgers used by the company. Ledgers can be of the following types: 

- _Actual_ , which is used to post all financial transactions that a company     performs 

- _Reporting_ , which stores the results of financial translations or consoli-     dation data imported to a parent company from consolidation units 

- _Statistical_ , which stores statistical information about a company’s op-     erations 

- _Budget_ , which stores budget information. 

_OrganizationLedgerLink_ Represents a many-to-many relation link between the Organization and Ledger records. 

_Organization_ Stores the information about companies. 

_Account_ Represents a chart of accounts that are defined in the system. When a user defines the chart of accounts, the user assigns to each account a name, a unique number by which it can be identified, and a type. Accounts can be of the following types: 

- _Asset_ 

- _Liability_ 

- _Income_ 

- _Expense_ 

_Sub_ Represents a subaccount. Subaccounts are used to virtually split accounts into smaller, more specific accounts to achieve finer classification, for reporting and internal management purposes. 

_FinYear_ Stores financial years in the system. 

_MasterFinYear_ Is a projection over the FinYear DAC. Master financial years are stored in the FinYear database table and have an OrganizationID value of _0_. The MasterFinYear records are defined on the _Master Financial Calendar_ (GL201000) form. 

_OrganizationFinYear_ Is a projection over FinYear. The DAC is used on the _Company Financial Calendar_ (GL201100) form. 

_FinPeriod_ Stores financial periods in the system. 

_MasterFinPeriod_ Is a projection over the FinPeriod DAC. Master financial periods are stored in the FinPeriod database table and have an OrganizationID value of _0_. The MasterFinPeriod records are defined on the _Master Financial Calendar_ (GL201000) form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 61 

 DAC Description 

 OrganizationFinPeriod Is a projection over FinPeriod. The DAC is used on the Company Financial Calendar (GL201100) form. 

#### GL Consolidation Reference Data 

 The importing of consolidation data is a process that imports GL balances (which are represented by GLHistory records) by financial period in a special way. For details about the configuration of this process, see Configuring GL Consolidation. 

 During the import process, the destination tenant connects to the source tenant (or they can be the same single tenant) and requests data for the specified ledger, branch, and mapped accounts and subaccounts. Then it filters data by the specified start and end period and processes it: The system calculates the difference between the last received data and the new data, and then it creates a batch with one GLTran record per history record. Aerward, the system updates the history records when the batch is posted. 

 The following tables lists the GL DACs related to the preferences for the import of consolidation data. 

 DAC Description 

 GLConsolSetup Represents the consolidation specification: the data about the source tenant, the connection credentials, and the parameters of consolidation, such as the period interval and the source and the destination branches and ledgers. 

 GLConsolLedger Represents the ledger that is available for consolidation in the source tenant. 

 GLConsolBranch Represents the branch that is available for consolidation in the source tenant. 

#### Allocation Reference Data 

 Allocation is the process of transferring amounts from specified account to another accounts by predefined allocation rules. Amounts are deducted from the source or contra account from the source ledger. These amounts are distributed and posted to the destination account in the proportion specified by the allocation ration in the allocation (destination) ledger. The allocation ratio can be fixed for destination accounts or can be calculated dynamically by the period-to-date or year-to-date balances of the base or destination accounts. 

 The allocation functionality is represented in the system by the following forms: 

- _Allocations_ (GL204500), where a user configures allocation rules. On the **Allocation History** tab, the     allocation GL batches are listed. 

- _Run Allocations_ (GL504500), which is a processing form where a user executes allocation by rules. The following table lists the GL DACs related to allocation preferences. 

 DAC Description 

 GLAllocation Represents the head of allocation rule aggregate. 

 GLAllocationSource Specifies the source part of the allocation rule. 

 GLAllocationDestination Specifies the destination part of the allocation rule.

 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 62 

### GL DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that store transactional data. 

#### Transactional DACs 

 Transactional DACs store the general ledger transactions and related entities. The GL DACs that hold transactional data are listed in the following table. 

 DAC Description 

 Batch Specifies the general information of the batch, such as the date of the batch, the ledger to which transactions should be posted, the branch (if your company has multiple branches), and the currency (if your company uses different currencies). 

 The DAC is a header for aggregated GLTran records. It makes sure that the set of GLTran records is balanced. 

 GLTran Represents a GL entry, which is a basic accounting record. A GLTran record defines which account and subaccount should be credited or debited and for how much. 

 GLAllocationHistory Represents a reference between the allocation rule and the created GL batch. 

#### Batch Release 

 The batch release process marks Batch and GLTran records as released and prepares the batch for posting. During the release process, the system performs the following steps: 

1. Validates the Batch record. For example, it verifies that the Batch record has the correct status and is     unreleased. 

2. Validates financial periods for both the Batch record and the GLTran record. 

3. Sets GLTran.Released to true. 

4. Updates the related _CATran_ record. 

5. Sets Batch.Released to true and sets Batch.Status to _U_ , which means that the batch is unposted. 

6. Creates project transactions that are related to the GLTran.AccountID, GLTran.ProjectID, and     GLTran.TaskID fields. 

7. Creates tax transactions that are related to the GLTran.TaxID field. 

8. Marks the _Currency_ record from Batch.CuryID as being in use. 

#### Batch Posting 

 The posting of batches is a key aspect of financial accounting in Acumatica ERP. During batch posting, the system updates the account history and the state of the transaction state. Posting also involves the handling of special options of batches, such as auto-reversing and inter-branch records: The process creates reversing batches with GL entries and balancing GL entries. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 63 

 A general responsibility of the posting process is to update a set of historical entities related to the batch. The main entry is the GLHistory record. The GLHistory DAC stores historical records that contain summarized data for the specified master financial period and accounting unit. 

 Also, during the posting process, the system calculates and processes the following: 

- _GLConsolHistory_ , which is used in GL consolidation process 

- _GLAllocationAccountHistory_ , which is used for allocations and project accounting entities During the posting process, the system performs the following steps: 

1. Validates financial periods for both the Batch record and the GLTran record. 

2. Updates the account history in GLHistory. 

3. Updates the allocation balance in GLAllocationAccountHistory. 

4. Updates the consolidation balance. 

5. Updates the project balance in _PMHistory_. 

6. Sets Batch.Posted to true and sets Batch.Status to _P_ , which means that the batch has been     posted. 

#### Trial Balance Import 

 By importing the trial balance, a user can reconcile the account balances (of the specified period) to the target balances. The user specifies the target YTD balance for the required account and subaccount. The system then calculates the difference between the current and specified amounts and generates adjusting GLTran records. On the Trial Balance (GL303010) form, a user can upload data from prepared Excel tables, validate it, and map the data to an existing account and subaccount. For details about the import of trial balances, see Import of Trial Balances. 

 The following table lists the GL DACs related to import of the trial balance. 

 DAC Description 

 GLTrialBalanceImportMap A header of the trial balance aggregate. 

 GLTrialBalanceImportDetails 

 A detail record of the trial balance aggregate. Each detail record is shown on the Transaction Details tab of the Trial Balance form and contains data for imported and actual account–subaccount pairs. 

 GLHistoryEnquiryWithSubResult 

 A DAC for intermediate calculations. The DAC holds the balances of the account–subaccount pairs. The system uses this DAC to display data on the Exceptions tab of the Trial Balance form and during the release of trial balances to calculate the amounts of the adjusting GLTran record. 

 A trial balance should be balanced. To enforce this requirement, the system checks the GLTrialBalanceImportMap.DebitTotalBalance and GLTrialBalanceImportMap.CreditTotalBalance fields. 

#### Release of Trial Balances 

 The release process calculates the difference between existing and specified balances for mapped account– subaccount pairs. It then generates the corresponding GLTran records and a batch of the special T type code. A batch of this type can be out of balance in the foreign currency because a user can import data for different accounts (including denominated ones). The process creates a shared CurrencyInfo record for GLTran records with the same account currency, CurrencyInfo.BaseCalc (which is set to false ), and rate (which is set to 1 ). 

 The system does the following during the release process: 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 64 

1. Creates a batch header. 

2. Iterates over balances for the specified period to check the list of mapped account–subaccount pairs and     select a suitable record. 

3. If the record was found, generates a GLTran record for the amount of the difference between the actual     and desired balances, and deletes the record from the list. 

4. If a suitable record was not found or there is no difference between the actual and desired balances,     proceeds with the next account–subaccount pair. 

5. Iterates over the remaining mapped records and creates GLTran records for the entire amount. 

6. Finalizes the batch header and marks the trial balance record as released. 

### GL DACs: Historical Data 

 Historical data access classes (DACs) keep historical information on GL transactions and turnover by period. 

#### GLHistory 

 A GLHistory record is a historical entity that accumulates GLTran amounts by financial period for a particular account and subaccount for reporting purposes. The GLHistory records are calculated from GLTran records during the posting of a batch. 

 GLHistory contains fields with the following prefixes: 

- Fin: The fields with this prefix contain the amounts that correspond to the amounts of the GLTran records     that can be found by the link from GLHistory.FinPeriodID to GLTran.FinPeriodID. 

- Tran: The fields with this prefix contain the amounts that correspond to the amounts of GLTran records     that can be found by the link from GLHistory.FinPeriodID to GLTran.TranPeriodID. 

- Cury: The fields with this prefix contain amounts in the currency of the record. 

#### GLHistoryByPeriod 

 GLHistoryByPeriod is a projection based on a join of the GLHistory and MasterFinPeriod DACs. GLHistoryByPeriod obtains the last period to which each GL entry has been posted (that is, the last period for which a GLHistory record exists) that is earlier than or the same as the specified period for each account– subaccount pair. 

 The GLHistoryByPeriod projection joins GLHistory records that have FinPeriodID that is earlier than or the same as the particular period to each MasterFinPeriod record. The result of join contains a set of all previous existing periods (including the current period) with posted data for each period. Then the projection groups the obtained set by the MasterFinPeriod.FinPeriodID field and extracts the maximum GLHistory.FinPeriodID as the last activity period for each group. See the calculation scheme in the following diagram. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing General Ledger DACs | 65 

 Figure: The calculation scheme 

 To obtain the last activity period for the needed period, you should specify the needed period for the GLHistoryByPeriod.FinPeriodID field. GLHistoryByPeriod.LastActivityPeriod will contain the last existing period with data. 

#### GLAllocationAccountHistory 

 The GLAllocationAccountHistory DAC stores the allocated amount for account–subaccount pair and contains a reference to the corresponding GL batch.

## Reviewing Project Accounting DACs 

 The project accounting functionality supports and automates the process of managing the organization's projects. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in the project accounting and learn about the relationships between them. 

### PM DACs: General Information 

 The system uses the project accounting data access classes (DACs), which have the PM prefix, to store information about projects and their settings. The settings of a project include the tasks that have been defined for a project and the employees, resources, and equipment assigned to it. For details about the project accounting processes, see Project Accounting in Acumatica ERP. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following data: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the DACs of project accounting 

- Transactional data 

- Historical data 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review the project accounting DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses project accounting data. 

- You need to design a report that uses project accounting data. 

- You need to customize the project accounting functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project_     _Editor_.

### PM DACs: Reference Data 

 In this topic, you can find information about the data access classes (DACs) that contain reference data that is used in most other DACs in project accounting. 

#### Project Accounting Preferences 

 The PMSetup DAC contains the general project accounting preferences, which are specified on the Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. 

 You can use the following example to obtain the project preferences of a particular tenant. 

 SELECT * FROM PMSetup s WHERE s.CompanyID = 2 

#### Account Groups 

 The PMAccountGroup DAC contains account groups for projects. The account groups are defined on the Account Groups (PM201000) form. 

 You can use the following example to select the list of active account groups with the Expense type. 

 SELECT 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 68 

 * FROM PMAccountGroup a WHERE a.IsActive=1 AND a.type='E' 

#### Rules for Project Billing 

 The PMBillingRule DAC contains the list of rules for project billing, which are defined on the Billing Rules (PM207000) form. 

 The following example shows how to select all rules with the Time and Material type. 

 SELECT * FROM PMBillingRule b WHERE b.type='T' 

#### Change Order Classes 

 The PMChangeOrderClass DAC contains the change order class data, which is defined on the Change Order Classes (PM203000) form. 

 The following example shows how to select the change order class with the specified ID. 

 SELECT * FROM PMChangeOrderClass c WHERE c.ClassID = 'DEFAULT' 

#### Project Rate Tables 

 If a project is billed with the Time and Material step of the billing rule and the @Rate parameter is used in the billing rule formula, the relevant rate from the configured rate table is used in the pro forma invoices. 

 A user configures each rate by performing the following steps: 

1. Adding a rate table code on the _Rate Table Codes_ (PM204200) form. The rate table data is stored in the     _PMRateTable_ DAC. 

2. Adding a rate type on the _Rate Types_ (PM204100) form. The rate type data is stored in the _PMRateType_     DAC. 

3. Defining a rule on the _Rate Table Sequences_ (PM205000) form. The rule data is stored in the     _PMRateDefinition_ DAC. A definition of a rule includes the addition of sequences and the defining of     conditions for each combination of a rate table and rate type. Conditions can be defined for the following     entities: 

- A project, whose ID is stored in the _PMProjectRate_ DAC 

- A project task, whose ID is stored in the _PMTaskRate_ DAC 

- An account group, whose ID is stored in the _PMAccountGroupRate_ DAC 

- An inventory item, whose ID is stored in the _PMItemRate_ DAC 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 69 

- An employee, whose ID is stored in the _PMEmployeeRate_ DAC 

4. Adding a rate sequence for each combination of rate table, rate type, and rate code on the _Rate Tables_     (PM206000) form. The rate sequence data is stored in the _PMRateSequence_ DAC. 

5. Adding a rate on the _Rate Tables_ (PM206000) form. The rate data is stored in the _PMRate_ DAC. 

 For details on the configuration of billing rates, see Billing Rates: General Information. 

 The following diagram shows the relationships between the project rate tables.

#### Projects, Project Templates, Customer Contracts, and Contract Templates 

 The Contract DAC contains the master data of the entities that are created and edited on the following data entry forms: 

- _Projects_ (PM301000) 

- _Project Templates_ (PM208000) 

- _Customer Contracts_ (CT301000) 

- _Contract Templates_ (CT202000) The following examples show how to obtain entities that satisfy particular conditions: 

- The selection of all projects with the _In Planning_ status 

 SELECT * FROM

 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 70 

 Contract p WHERE p.Status='D' AND p.BaseType='P' AND p.NonProject=0 AND IsTemplate=0 

- The selection of _Non-Project_ items 

 SELECT * FROM Contract WHERE NonProject=1 

#### Project Tasks 

 The PMTask DAC contains the tasks that are defined in the table on the Tasks tab of the Projects (PM301000) form —that is, the tasks of a particular project. 

 The following examples illustrate the selection of project tasks that meet specific conditions: 

- The selection of the tasks for the specified project 

 SELECT * FROM PMTask t WHERE t.ProjectID = 3312 

- The selection of all common tasks 

 SELECT * FROM PMTask INNER JOIN Contract ON PMTask.ProjectID = Contract.ContractID WHERE Contract.NonProject = 1 

 The PMTaskAllocTotal DAC contains the quantity and the previously allocated amount for the project tasks with the Allocate Budget allocation method specified on the Calculation Rules tab of the Allocation Rules (PM207500) form. (The previously allocated amount, which is expressed in the project currency, is stored in the PMTaskAllocTotal.Amount field.) The class contains data that is not available in the UI but that can be useful for troubleshooting and data migration. 

#### Project Budget Lines 

 The PMBudget DAC contains the project budget lines that are defined on the following forms: 

- _Projects_ (PM301000), on the **Revenue Budget** and **Cost Budget** tabs 

- _Project Budget_ (PM309000) 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 71 

 Project budget lines aggregate the project balance amounts and quantities by project ID, project task ID, cost code, account group, and inventory ID. 

 The selection of project budget lines that meet particular conditions is illustrated in the following examples: 

- The selection of project budget lines for the specified project with the specified account group 

 SELECT * FROM PMBudget b WHERE b.ProjectID = 3293 AND b.AccountGroupID=23 

- The selection of the cost project budget of the specified project 

 SELECT * FROM PMBudget WHERE Type = 'E' AND ProjectID = 3293 

- The selection of the budget lines entered for the out-of-balance account group 

 SELECT * FROM PMBudget INNER JOIN PMAccountGroup ON PMBudget.AccountGroupID = PMAccountGroup.GroupID WHERE PMAccountGroup.Type = 'O' 

#### Change Order Budgets 

 The PMChangeOrderBudget DAC contains the lines that are defined on the Revenue Budget and Cost Budget tabs of the Change Orders (PM308000) form. 

 The following example shows the retrieval of the list of change order budgets with the specified project and account group. 

 SELECT * FROM PMChangeOrderBudget c WHERE c.ProjectID = 29 AND c.AccountGroupID = 2 

### PM DACs: Transactional Data 

 In this topic, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that provide transactional data. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 72 

#### Project Transactions 

 The PMRegister table contains the transaction data that is defined in the Summary area of the Project Transactions (PM304000) form. 

 The following example shows the retrieval of the released allocation batches. 

 SELECT * FROM PMRegister WHERE IsAllocation = 1 AND Released = 1 

 The PMTran DAC contains the transactional data that is displayed in the table on the Project Transactions (PM304000) form. A project transaction (PMTran) is referenced in a general ledger transaction (GLTran) by the GLTran.PMTranID field. 

 The selection of project transactions that meet specific conditions is illustrated in the following examples: 

- The selection of the unbilled transactions for the project with the specified account group 

 SELECT * FROM PMTran t WHERE t.AccountGroupID = 23 AND t.ProjectID=3295 AND t.Billed=0 

- The selection of the billed transactions from the specified AR invoice 

 SELECT PMTran.* FROM PMTran INNER JOIN ARTran ON PMTran.CompanyID = ARTran.CompanyID AND PMTran.ARTranType = ARTran.TranType AND PMTran.ARRefNbr = ARTran.RefNbr AND PMTran.RefLineNbr = ARTran.LineNbr WHERE ARTran.TranType='INV' AND ARTran.RefNbr='00013' 

#### Pro Forma Invoices 

 Pro forma invoices are defined on the Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. The PMProforma DAC contains the pro forma invoice data, which is specified in the Summary area of the form. The PMProformaLine DAC stores the pro forma line data, which is displayed on the Progress Billing and Time and Material tabs of the form. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Project Accounting DACs | 73 

#### Billing Records 

 The PMBillingRecord DAC contains the billing record data, which is displayed in the table on the Invoices tab of the Projects (PM301000) form. 

 In the following example, you can see how to select a billing record for the specified project. 

 SELECT * FROM PMBillingRecord b WHERE b.ProjectID=3295 

### PM DACs: Historical Data 

 Historical data access classes (DACs) keep historical data on projects' actual amounts and actual quantities. 

#### Projects' Actual Amounts and Actual Quantities 

 The PMHistory DAC contains the projects' actual amounts and actual quantities aggregated by financial periods. The columns with the Fin prefix reflect totals for the company-specific financial period, which depends on the branch ID of the aggregated record. The columns with the Tran prefix reflect totals by the master financial period, which is global across the tenant. 

 The following example shows how to select data from the PMHistory DAC for the project with the specified account group. 

 SELECT * FROM PMHistory h WHERE h.ProjectID = 3295 AND h.AccountGroupID = 23 

#### Change Orders' Amounts and Quantities 

 The PMForecastHistory DAC holds period-based actual amounts and quantities, and change orders' amounts and quantities in the project budget structure. The data is stored only in the project currency. The data of this DAC is displayed on the Project Budget Forecast (PM209600) form. This form is available if the Budget Forecast feature is enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. However, the balances are always calculated and stored in the PMForecastHistory table regardless of whether the feature is enabled. The data of this DAC is used for reporting. 

 PMHistory and PMForecastHistory DACs store different data. In the PMHistory DAC, the amounts are stored both in the base currency and in the project currency; no data on change orders or change requests is included.

#### Actual-to-Date Amounts and Budget Amounts in Reports 

 You can retrieve actual-to-date values from the PMHistory DAC, which you can join with PMBudget for the respective budget amounts. To join PMHistory and PMBudget, you can use the project ID, project task ID, and account group ID. This join provides the reports at the project, project task, and account group levels of detail. 

 A project budget is updated according to the values that are selected in the Cost Budget Level and Revenue Budget Level boxes on the Summary tab of the Projects (PM301000) form and the Cost Budget Update and Revenue Budget Update boxes on the Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. A part of the information from project transactions is stored in the PMBudget records aggregated by InventoryID, CostCodeID, or TaskID. For these records, the inventory ID or the cost code ID (or both identifiers) can have a default value instead of the one in the transaction. PMHistory always contains the most detailed information from project transactions. Therefore, the InventoryID and CostCodeID values can be different between PMHistory and PMBudget. Thus, when joining these tables, you should consider the conditions of project budget levels.

## Reviewing Tax DACs 

 You can use the tax-related functionality of Acumatica ERP for the automatic calculation of tax amounts on documents in Acumatica ERP, such as bills and invoices. In this chapter, you can find an overview of the data access classes (DACs) that are used in tax calculation and reporting and learn about the relationships between these DACs. 

### TX DACs: General Information 

 The system uses the tax DACs, which are available in the PX.Objects.TX namespace, for the following main purposes: 

- Tax calculation for documents and their lines 

- Generation and release of the tax report The system also uses tax DACs for the configuration of tax calculation and reporting. For details about taxes in Acumatica ERP, see _Taxes_. 

#### Learning Objectives 

 In this chapter, you will learn about the DACs that are related to the following information: 

- Reference data that is used in most of the tax DACs 

- Transactional data 

- Reporting data 

#### Applicable Scenarios 

 You review tax DACs in the following cases: 

- You need to create a generic inquiry that uses tax data. 

- You need to design a report that uses tax data. 

- You need to customize the tax functionality by adjusting it in the _Customization Project Editor_. 

- You need to customize the tax functionality by writing customization code. 

#### Basic Relationships Between TX DACs 

 The following diagram shows basic relationships between tax DACs. For detailed descriptions of DACs and DAC fields, look for the needed DAC in the DAC Schema Browser. (For details about the DAC Schema Browser, see Data from Multiple Data Sources: DAC Schema Browser .)

 Figure: Relationships between TX DACs 

### TX DACs: Reference Data 

 The following types of DACs provide reference data: 

- The common DACs that are used when taxes are configured. These DACs also hold the rules of tax     calculation. 

- The report configuration DACs that are used for the tax report structure. The DACs also contain the     calculation rules. The following sections describe these DACs in more detail. 

#### Common DACs 

 The common tax DACs, excluding tax agencies (which are represented by Vendor records), provide the basis for tax calculation for various documents in the system. Users manually specify the settings that are stored in these DACs, which are listed in the following table. 

 DAC Name Description 

 Tax A record of this DAC represents a tax. The Tax properties describe the tax type and its calculation rules. 

 TaxRev A record of this DAC contains the tax rate that is effective at a certain date. A TaxRev record specifies the reporting group (and in turn report lines because a reporting group is a set of reporting lines) for which tax amounts will be aggregated during report preparation. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Tax DACs | 77 

 DAC Name Description 

 TaxCategory A record of this DAC represents a tax category. This record is the header of a master-detail aggregate of a set of taxes. This record is used for the definition of the set of taxes that can be applied to a document line. TaxCategoryDet is a detail of TaxCategory. The DAC implements a many-to-many relationship between Tax and TaxCategory. 

 TaxZone A record of this DAC represents a tax zone. This record is the header of the master-detail aggregate of a set of taxes. This record is used for the definition of the set of taxes that can be applied to the document. A TaxZoneDet record is a detail of a TaxZone record. The DAC implements a many-to-many relationship between Tax and TaxZone. 

 Vendor A record of this DAC represents the tax agency to which the tax is to be reported and paid. Also, a Vendor record specifies the calendar rules of reporting, default tax GL accounts, and tax report rounding rules. The Vendor.TaxAgency field indicates whether a vendor is a tax agency. 

 In Acumatica ERP, tax zones and tax categories are used to determine the sets of taxes that are applied to a document line. The TaxZone DAC contains the data of each tax zone that has been defined on the Tax Zones (TX206000) form, and the TaxCategory DAC holds the data of each tax category that has been defined on the Tax Categories (TX205500) form. A tax zone and a tax category each contain a set of taxes. A tax zone is specified for a document; a tax category is specified for a document line. The resulting set of taxes that will be applied to the document line is the intersection of the tax zone and tax category sets of taxes. 

#### Report Configuration DACs 

 The TaxReportLine DAC contains tax report lines. A TaxReportLine record defines the tax report structure for a particular tax agency and is a part of formation amount rules. The DAC is mapped as many-to-many to reporting groups (which are stored in TaxBucket ) and through them to taxes. 

 TaxBucket is the header of the master-detail aggregate, which specifies a set of tax agency report lines to be used for calculated tax amounts aggregation. TaxBucket is linked to Tax as one to many. 

 A TaxBucketLine record is a detail of a TaxBucket. The TaxBucketLine DAC implements the many-tomany relationship between the TaxReportLine and TaxBucket. TaxBucketLine is also created for report lines that are detailed by tax zones. 

### TX DACs: Transactional Data 

 The system calculates taxes for documents and document lines. There are two different types of tax calculation rules: item-level and document-level. The system, however, forms and stores tax data for both a document and its lines, regardless of the tax calculation rule. 

 The system stores tax calculation results in the following DACs: 

- For a document line, in the XXTax DAC, where _XX_ stands for the two-letter abbreviation of the functional     area, such as _AR_ or _AP_ 

- For a document, in the TaxTran DAC 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Tax DACs | 78 

#### XXTax 

 XXTax is a DAC that contains the tax amounts for each tax that is applied to a document line in the XX functional area of the document. For example, for AR invoice lines, the DAC is ARTax. 

#### TaxTran 

 TaxTran is a DAC that serves both of the following purposes at the same time: 

- TaxTran is a record of the tax amount that can be reported to a tax period. The tax report is built from     these records. Aer the tax report has been prepared, the reportable TaxTran record can belong to     multiple tax periods. 

- TaxTran is an entity that stores the tax amount for the document for each applied tax. The system includes     the following groups of such entities: 

- Reportable TaxTran entities: DACs of this group are descendants of the TaxTran DAC, such as     _APTaxTran_ , _ARTaxTran_ , and _CATaxTran_. The data of these DACs is stored in the TaxTran     database table. In the following special cases, these TaxTran records are not reported: 

- A TaxTran record that represents the amounts of a withholding tax for a simple AP bill or     adjustment. These TaxTran records exist only for intermediate tax calculation and to show the tax     amount to the user. The reportable TaxTran record for this record is created when the document is     paid. 

- A TaxTran record that represents suspended VAT amounts. 

- Lines of a tax bill, tax credit adjustment, or tax debit adjustment. 

- TaxTran entities whose purpose is only to aggregate the tax amount for document that can be shown     in a user interface: Records of these DACs do not have a use that pertains to tax accounting. These DACs,     such as _SOTaxTran_ and _SOTax_ , do not inherit from the TaxTran DAC. The TaxTran DAC contains amounts without the sign by which this tax report amount will be adjusted. The sign is available in the Sign field of the _TaxTranReport_ projection DAC. 

#### TaxTranReport 

 The TaxTranReport DAC is a projection over TaxTran. In addition to the fields of the TaxTran DAC, it contains the following two fields: 

- TranTypeInvoiceDiscriminated: A user-friendly value of TranType. 

- Sign: A sign multiplier for the calculation of the report amount. To get the amount of the TaxTran with     the sign that will be included in the report, you need to multiply all of the following: 

- Sign 

- The sign of LineMult (which is the update rule) of the TaxReportLine record 

- The amount that is specified in the TaxTran record 

#### Tax Bill and Adjustments 

 A tax bill is a special document that creates a TaxTran record for an AP document. A tax bill has an APInvoice record as a header and TaxTran records as document lines. The TaxTran lines of a tax bill are not reportable. 

 A record in the TaxAdjustment DAC represents the header of a tax adjustment document. The lines of this document are represented by TaxTran records. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Reviewing Tax DACs | 79 

#### Tax Period and Tax Year 

 The TaxPeriod DAC holds the records of the agency tax period for the tenant. The records of this type are created on the Prepare Tax Report (TX501000) form when the user selects a tax agency. All the periods of a year are created at the same time. If the user voids the tax report for the first period of a year, the system deletes all the tax periods for that year. 

 The TaxYear DAC contains the tax year records. A tax year is a supplementary entity for tax period generation. 

### TX DACs: Reporting Data 

 Reporting data is used to generate the next tax report, store the generated data, and represent the tax report itself. 

#### Tax Reporting 

 Tax reporting consists of the following processes: 

- Tax report preparation: The system creates a tax period (which is represented by a _TaxPeriod_ record) if     necessary, and assigns the corresponding _TaxTran_ records to the period. The system then generates the     tax report by aggregating document-level tax data. That is, TaxTran records are aggregated into a set of     _TaxHistory_ records. 

- Tax report voiding: The system deletes the previously created tax report and marks the corresponding     TaxTran records as unreported. 

- Tax report release: The system closes the tax period and generates a tax agency bill. A released tax report can be altered by a tax adjustment (which is represented by a _TaxAdjustment_ record). The report's lines are represented by TaxTran records. 

#### Tax Report 

 The structure of the tax report is defined by a set of report lines (which are stored in the TaxReportLine DAC). For tax report generation purposes, they are combined into reporting groups (which are stored in the TaxBucket DAC). 

 A tax report is represented by a set of TaxHistory records. TaxHistory is a record that contains the detailed data for the report line, and multiple TaxHistory records can exist for one report line. TaxHistory is an aggregation of the corresponding TaxTran records. When a tax report is prepared, TaxTran updates TaxHistory records of multiple report lines. The TaxReportLine records for update are obtained for each tax, its type, and the start date from the reporting group that is specified in the corresponding TaxRev record.
