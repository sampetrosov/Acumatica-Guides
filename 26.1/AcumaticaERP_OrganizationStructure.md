## Overview of Organization Structure Processes 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the structure of your organization as consisting of a single branch or multiple branches with different reporting settings to suit complex reporting requirements and data consolidation needs. 

 Also, by using the Organization Structure module, your organization can automate work assignments and document assignment for approvals. 

#### Multibranch Functionality 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system as a single entity or as a multibranch organization to match the actual organization's structure. All branches of the organization use the same currency and chart of accounts, and have shared lists of trade partners. You can configure automatic balancing of inter-branch transactions. If the branches operate separately, you can set up user access to specific branches only. For additional information, see the following topics: 

- _Multiple Branch Support_ 

- _Basic Models for Multibranch Organization_ 

- _Security of Organization Branches_ 

#### Organizational Chart and Assignment Automation 

 You can build a company tree, which is a model of your organization's hierarchy that includes branches and departments, as well as temporary or permanent workgroups. The company tree may reflect the administrative hierarchy and include subhierarchies of workgroups created within specific branches or departments. The company tree is used for creating assignment rules in approval and assignment maps and for determining the scope of the users who want to view items assigned to them. You can use assignment maps to automatically distribute the work items (such as leads, contacts, opportunities, or cases) to be processed or you can use approval maps to distribute the documents (such as time cards, expense receipts, or orders) to be approved among the workgroups, based on relevant item or document properties. For more information, see the following articles: 

- _Company Tree and Workgroups_ 

- _Managing Assignment Maps_ 

- _Approval Configuration: Approval Maps_ 

#### Other Features and Options 

 Acumatica ERP provides unmatched flexibility for each organization to implement its unique business processes by using the Organization Structure functionality. In addition to the features described above, the Organization Structure functionality offers the following features and options: 

- You can use departments, employee positions, and information about to whom each employee reports to     build any hierarchy to be used in assignment and approval maps. 

- Buildings can be assigned to branches and depreciated accordingly in the respective branches. 

- Multiple work calendars may be used in the organization to correctly estimate work time and overtime in     different branches and on different projects, as described in _Support of Multiple Work Calendars_.

## Managing Companies and Branches 

 In Acumatica ERP, a company represents a legal entity with an independent balance sheet and separate tax reporting. An organization may consist of one company or multiple companies. 

 A company may have no branches, or it may consist of multiple branches, each being a separate office or a point of sale. Companies with multiple branches can be configured and maintained in Acumatica ERP only if the Multibranch Support and Multicompany Support features are enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. On the same form, the Inter-Branch Transactions feature should be enabled if different branches of a company can participate in one transaction. 

 All branches within a tenant have the same chart of accounts, calendar, and base currency. 

#### In This Chapter 

- _Companies and Branches_ 

- _Multiple Branch Support_ 

- _Basic Models for Multibranch Organization_ 

- _Security of Organization Branches_ 

### Companies and Branches 

 In Acumatica ERP, a user can create new companies or maintain existing companies by using the Companies (CS101500) form. 

 Multiple companies can be configured in one tenant of Acumatica ERP if the Multicompany Support feature has been enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. 

#### Company Type 

 Each company has one of the following types, which is specified in the Company Type box on the Companies (CS101500) form: 

- _Without Branches_ : A company with this type cannot have any branches. If the _Multibranch Support_ feature is     disabled on the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form, this option is selected by default and cannot be     changed. If the _Multibranch Support_ feature is disabled and the _Multicompany Support_ feature is enabled,     you can create multiple companies without branches in one tenant. 

- _With Branches Not Requiring Balancing_ : A company with this type must have at least one branch. If multiple     branches of the company are involved in a transaction, balancing entries are not required. This option is     available if the _Multibranch Support_ feature is enabled on the _Enable/Disable Features_ form. 

- _With Branches Requiring Balancing_ : A company with this type must have at least one branch. If multiple     branches of the company are involved in a transaction, balancing entries are required. This option is     available if the _Multibranch Support_ and _Inter-Branch Transactions_ features are enabled on the _Enable/_     _Disable Features_ form. For details about how Acumatica ERP supports multiple branches for a company, see _Multiple Branch Support_. 

 Aer a company has been configured, the company type still can be changed as follows.

 With Branches Requiring Balancing With Branches Not Requiring Balancing 

 No transactions have been posted by company branches or the company has only one branch. 

#### Company Statuses 

 When you create a new company on the Companies (CS101500) form, the company is assigned the default status of Active. Active companies and their branches can be selected on data entry forms and in reports. However, at some point, you may need to remove a company from the system, so that users will not be able to select the company and its branches on data entry forms and reports. In this case, you deactivate the company by clicking Deactivate on the More menu of the Companies form. 

 You can later activate the company again by clicking Activate on the More menu of the Companies form. 

 If the Multiple Calendar Support feature is disabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form and you activate a company, the system performs the following actions: 

1. Compares the set of financial periods in the master calendar with the set of financial periods of the current     company. (Only the IDs of the periods are compared—not their starting and ending dates.) If these sets are     different, the system generates the missing periods for the company. You can view these periods on the     _Company Financial Calendar_ (GL201100) form. 

2. On the _Company Financial Calendar_ form, assigns the period's status and the states of the **Closed in AP** ,     **Closed in AR** , **Closed in IN** , **Closed in CA** , and **Closed in FA** check boxes for each new period in the company     calendar according to the following rules: 

- If the _Centralized Period Management_ feature is enabled, the period's status and the states of the **Closed**     **in <Subledger>** check boxes are copied from the corresponding settings of the master calendar. 

- If the _Centralized Period Management_ feature is disabled and the missing period is the first added period     in the company calendar, the period's status and the states of the **Closed in <Subledger>** check boxes     are copied from earliest period of the company calendar.     If the missing period is added in the middle of the company calendar—that is, if there are periods before     and aer the added period—the period's status and the states of the **Closed in <Subledger>** check boxes     are copied from the period just before the added period.     If the missing period is added to the end of the company calendar—that is, if there are no periods aer     the added period—the added period is assigned the _Inactive_ status, and the **Closed in <Subledger>**     check boxes are cleared. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 7 

 If the Fixed Asset Management feature is enabled and the Multiple Calendar Support feature is disabled on the Enable/Disable Features form, and you activate a company on the Companies form, the system performs the following actions: 

- Checks whether each period in the general ledger calendar has a matching period in the calendar of the     company's posting book. (Only the IDs of the periods are compared.) 

- Generates the missing periods in the company's posting book. For more details about financial periods, see _Generating Financial Calendars_ , _Financial Calendar Generation: General Information_ , and _Managing Financial Periods_. 

#### Company Maintenance 

 For a company that has the With Branches Not Requiring Balancing or With Branches Requiring Balancing type, the Branches tab becomes available on the Companies (CS101500) form. On this tab, a system administrator can add new branches to the company or delete branches from the list of company branches; when the company has no branches, it can be also deleted. 

 A company with the Without Branches type can be deleted if it has no GL history (that is, if no GL transactions are associated with the company) and if no cash accounts, employees, warehouses, and fixed assets are linked to the company. 

 If a user clicks Deactivate on the More menu of the Companies form for a company that has branches, all the company branches will be deactivated. However, a branch cannot be deactivated if it is linked to an active warehouse, to an employee with a status other than Inactive , or to a fixed asset with a status other than Disposed or Reversed , and a company with such a branch also cannot be deactivated. 

#### Configuration of Access to Company Data 

 Access to the data related to a specific branch or to all branches of a company is regulated by an access role. 

 When an access role is specified for a company in the Access Role box on the Companies (CS101500) form, the system prompts whether the access role should be copied to the settings of all branches of the company. When the Access Role box is cleared for the company, the system prompts whether the access role should be removed from the settings of all branches of the company. If no access role is specified for the company, an individual access role can be specified for each branch of the company on the Branches (CS102000) from. 

 A user that has access to at least one of the company branches can select the company in corresponding boxes on data entry forms. 

 For more information about ways to manage the security of a branch, see Security of Organization Branches. 

#### Ledgers 

 A company can post transactions to various ledgers, but it can be associated with only one actual ledger. 

 A user can manage ledgers associated with a company in any of the following ways: 

- Create for a new company a ledger of the _Actual_ type by clicking **Create Ledger** on the More menu (under     **Other** ) of the _Companies_ (CS101500) form 

- Review the list of the ledgers associated with the company, add an existing ledger to the list, or remove a     ledger from the list by using the **Ledgers** tab of the _Companies_ form 

- Review the list of all ledgers associated with the company of the selected branch by using the **Ledgers** tab of     the _Branches_ (CS102000) form 

- Maintain the list of the companies that are allowed to post to non-actual ledgers by using the _Ledgers_     (GL201500) form An actual ledger can be detached from a company if the ledger contains no transactions associated with any branch of the company. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 8 

 For more information about ledgers, see the Managing Ledgers chapter. 

#### Tax Reports 

 For a company with the With Branches Requiring Balancing type, the File Taxes by Branches check box is available on the Companies (CS101500) form. If the check box is cleared, each tax report includes data related to all branches of the company. If the check box is selected, each branch of the company requires an individual report. 

 For a company with any other type, tax reports always include company-wide data. 

#### Visual Appearance 

 On the Visual Appearance tab of the Companies (CS101500) or Branches (CS102000) form, a user can specify separate images for the logo displayed in the top le corner of Acumatica ERP and for the logo displayed on reports for the selected company or branch. 

### Multiple Branch Support 

 Sooner or later, small and medium-sized businesses may face the challenges presented by growth. The organization can grow by adding new locations that become branches with some degree of autonomy. 

 Because most Acumatica ERP customers are small and mid-sized businesses, the multibranch functionality has been developed for organizations that meet certain requirements: 

- All branches use the same base currency. 

- The chart of accounts is shared among branches, or similar charts of accounts used by different branches     can be merged into one chart of accounts used by all branches. 

- The branches have the same financial year and periods. Larger organizations with base currencies different in different branches, fiscal years, and periods can configure their subsidiaries as separate organizations with individual company IDs and use the consolidation functionality to be able to report as a single company. For details, see _Configuring GL Consolidation_ and _Performing GL Consolidation_. 

#### Organization as a Structure of Branches 

 Acumatica ERP supports multibranch functionality and provides several basic models for implementing most typical organization structures. For details, see Basic Models for Multibranch Organization. 

 In Acumatica ERP, an organization has a company account with a company ID. Within a company account, at least one branch is needed to represent the organization itself. If the organization includes more than one branch, organization branches are created within the same company ID. The identifiers for branches (Branch IDs) are based on the BIZACCT segmented key—that is, they have the same segments as identifiers for organization's customers and vendors. 

#### User Access to Branch Data 

 Since the branches are created within the same organization, they have some shared data and some branchspecific data. 

 Each employee (user) is assigned to a specific branch. To restrict user access to branch-specific data, you can configure a branch access role for each branch. Then the branch employees will be able to access the shared data (as their roles allow) and the data specific to their branch. To employees who should have access to other branches too, you must assign the access roles for the branches in the user's scope. For details, see Security of Organization 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 9 

 Branches. If a user has access to several branches, the user will be able to choose the branch he or she needs by selecting it from the form toolbar on each data entry form. 

#### Data Shared Between Branches 

 Some of the data is unconditionally shared and available in all branches for all users who have access to this data by their roles. 

 In addition to the financial year and periods, the organization's branches share the following information: 

- The chart of accounts. 

- Subaccounts. 

- Budget tree, for details, see _Budget Tree_. 

- Taxes, tax categories, and tax zones. 

- Credit terms and overdue charges. 

- Statement cycles. 

- Customer and vendor classes. 

- Customers and vendors. You can specify for some customer and vendor locations a default branch with     which they have operations, and this location will be unavailable for selection from other branches. 

- Stock and non-stock items. If you need to view inventory by branch, configure the _INVENTORY_ segmented     key appropriately, with a segment designating a branch to which the item belongs, but all items will be     visible in the list of available items. 

- Lot and serial classes. 

- Units of measure and conversion rules. 

- Posting classes for inventory. Company tree and assignment maps should include workgroups that belong to all branches. Approval routes may pass across the entire organization. 

 You can use the functionality of restriction groups to assign specific accounts and subaccounts to a particular branch. For details, see Security of Organization Branches. 

#### Branch-Specific Data 

 The following entities are assigned to only one of the branches: 

- Cash accounts (each of which is denominated in a specific currency) 

- Warehouses 

- Employees 

- Buildings (a sort of fixed asset) Do not create a subaccount segment for branches; transactions are marked by the originating branch in other ways. Bills and invoices as well as other documents are associated with the particular branch in which they were created. To make them easily identifiable by branch, you can create branch-specific subsequences for all numbering sequences involved by using the _Numbering Sequences_ (CS201020) form, so that a document originating in a specific branch will have a reference number clearly associated with the branch of origin. 

 If a user has a branch access role that provides access to only one of the branches, the user will be able to view only the documents related to the respective branch. 

#### Data Consolidation 

 The multibranch functionality, as it is implemented in Acumatica ERP, enables complex organizations to view the consolidated data from multiple branches without having to perform any additional operations and in real time. It 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 10 

 is easy to configure consolidated replenishment or centralized payment of bill or view consolidated data on reports running them from the headquarters branch. 

 When a user opens a report or inquiry, the system checks the user's access rights to branches. If a user has access to all branches, this user can view the data of any selected branch or the consolidated data by leaving the Branch box blank. If a user has access to only one branch, this user will be able to view only the data related to the particular branch even if he or she runs the report that should show the consolidated data. 

 Replenishment is performed on a branch basis, although you can implement the following scenario: The headquarters has a large warehouse for which you configure automatic replenishment. Warehouses assigned to other branches are replenished through transfers from the headquarters' warehouse. Thus, your organization will be able to save on volume discounts. 

 In your system, bills can be paid by a headquarters branch on behalf of other branches. To do this, assign to authorized personnel the roles that provide access to branches. Then the employees who pay the bills will be able to view the bills from all branches on the Checks and Payments (AP302000) and Prepare Payments (AP503000) forms. The cash accounts from which payments are made should be assigned to the headquarters branch.

### Basic Models for Multibranch Organization 

 In today’s global environment, an organization may have a hierarchic structure of subsidiaries or branches and complex multilevel reporting requirements. Such an organization may need tools for easy data consolidation, as well as better visibility into various layers of financial operations within the organization. 

 Acumatica ERP supports multibranch functionality and provides multiple basic one-level and two-level models, outlined in the sections below, for implementing the most typical organizational structures. For more complex organizations, such models may be combined to implement any structure. 

 Choosing the model (or combination of models) that suits your organization best is an important decision that must be made before you start implementing Acumatica ERP. 

#### Model 1: Organization with Centralized Accounting 

 With Model 1, shown in the illustration below, the organization, which is a single legal entity, consists of two branches (or locations), each branch representing a company office. Transactions are posted to these branches. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 11 

 To implement this model in Acumatica ERP, you have to create an additional branch that will represent the legal entity. You also have to have one posting ledger of the Actual type. 

 You need to specify the additional branch as the consolidating branch for the posting ledger by using the Consolidation Branch column on the Ledgers (GL201500) form. The consolidating branch is used only in Form 1099-MISC and tax reports to represent the legal entity. No transactions are posted to the consolidating branch. 

 To be able to use automatic generation of interbranch balancing entries for documents that involve multiple branches, you need to enable the Inter-Branch Transactions feature on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, configure the posting ledger by selecting the check box in the Branch Accounting column for this ledger on the Ledgers (GL201500) form, and define the interbranch account mapping by using the Inter-Branch Account Mapping (GL101010) form. 

 If the Branch Accounting check box is cleared for the ledger, you still can make transactions between the branches (for example, transfer fixed assets from one branch to another), but the system does not create interbranch balancing entries. The resulting batch remains unbalanced in each of the smaller branches, but the batch is balanced in the ledger that is assigned to the consolidating branch. In this case, the branches are not independent, and separate balance sheet reports cannot be prepared. 

#### Model 2: Autonomous Branches 

 In Model 2, illustrated below, the organization has a number of branches with a certain level of autonomy, with each branch being a legal entity. The organization and its branches share most of the vendors and customers but keep some of the trade partners as associated with a specific branch. Each branch keeps records of its own and has an accountant or accounting staff. The profitability of each branch can be equally important. 

 In Acumatica ERP, autonomous branches may use separate ledgers to post their transactions or they may post their transactions to a single ledger with no branch selected as a consolidation branch. If the branches post their transactions to separate ledgers, the system will generate interbranch transactions automatically. If the branches use the same ledger, to balance the original interbranch transactions in each branch, you should select for this 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 12 

 ledger a check box in the Branch Accounting column on the Ledgers (GL201500) form. This allows each branch to file reports as a separate legal entity. 

 A certain level of independence requires that some of branches have their own General Ledger accounts that cannot be used by another branch. You can use restriction groups to assign selected General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to a specific branch for use by this branch only. 

#### Model 3: Autonomous Multilocation Branches 

 An organization might include a number of related legal entities with complex structures. Each legal entity has its headquarters and locations or smaller branches that are not separate legal entities. In this case, each autonomous multilocation entity keeps its own records and performs all accounting procedures. 

 In Acumatica ERP, such an organization can be configured as a Model 3, which combines Model 1 and Model 2, functioning within one Company ID. (See the following illustration.) Each autonomous branch has its headquarters and locations (or smaller branches that are not separate legal entities) configured as branches. Each autonomous multilocation branch records its operations to a separate ledger with a headquarters branch specified as the consolidation branch for the ledger. 

 Generally, when transactions occur between any two non-independent branches in one ledger, no interbranch transactions are generated; however, if they are needed for any reason, you can select a check box in the Branch Accounting column on the Ledgers (GL201500) form for the ledger. 

 When the interbranch transactions occur between any branches with different posting ledgers, balancing interbranch transactions will be generated automatically. You should create interbranch receivable and payable accounts in each ledger and specify the rules to be used by the system for generating balancing transactions by using the Inter-Branch Account Mapping (GL101010) form. 

#### Model 4: Multinational or Just Multicurrency Organization 

 Small and midsize businesses sooner or later may face the problem of growth. They can grow by mergers or by creating local subsidiaries or branches in new regions or countries. Due to their locations, the organization subsidiaries use different base (functional) currency and should meet different reporting requirements (including non-matching financial years); their customers and vendors are not shared. For historical reasons, the organization subsidiaries may have different structures of accounts and subaccounts. 

 In Acumatica ERP, such subsidiaries can have separate tenant accounts with different Company IDs. The simplest structure is shown by Model 4, illustrated below. Although technically the parent organization and its subsidiaries may keep their data in the same database, they may have different base currencies, different financial year settings, and separate lists of trade partners. Such subsidiaries even can be hosted on different websites. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 13 

 Acumatica ERP provides the consolidation-related functionality to be used by both sides: the parent organization and its subsidiaries. If different base currencies are used by the parent company and its subsidiary, such subsidiaries can translate their balances before they prepare the consolidation data for exporting. For details, see GL Consolidation Configuration: General Information , GL Consolidation: General Information , and Translation of Financial Statements: General Information. 

 If interbranch transactions take place, they should be eliminated manually during period-end or year-end routine procedures.

### Security of Organization Branches 

 If your organization has multiple branches defined in Acumatica ERP, you may need to control which employees get access to which branches. Because branches share some data, you may also need to control access to the shared data. Acumatica ERP provides user access roles, which you can use to control users' access to branches, and restriction groups to limit the visibility of shared data. In this topic, you will read about ways to manage the security of a branch. 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see Types of Restriction Groups. 

#### Usage Scenarios 

 The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the following: 

- Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches (and you have created     multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in     these branches. For details, see _User Access to Branches_. 

- Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make data shared between     branches (such as general ledger accounts and subaccounts) visible only within a particular branch, you can     use restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see _Visibility of Data Within a Branch_. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Companies and Branches | 14 

 You can create and maintain multiple branches in your Acumatica ERP instance only if the Multibranch Support feature is enabled in your system on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form (for details, see Multiple Branch Support ). 

#### User Access to Branches 

 Aer multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows: 

1. On the _User Roles_ (SM201005) form, you create branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign     these roles to user accounts. For details on user roles, see _User Roles: General Information_. 

2. On the _Branches_ (CS102000) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the     **Access Role** box, you select the user role created for this branch. To allow a user to access multiple     branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access. 

 Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user. 

 If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the Branches menu on the form's title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch. 

 No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms): 

- _Inter-Branch Account Mapping_ (GL101010) 

- _Branches_ (CS102000) 

- _Buildings_ (CS205010) 

- _Assignment and Approval Maps_ (EP205000) 

- _Import Company Tree_ (EP204060) 

- _Restriction Groups by Branch_ (GL103020) 

- _GL Accounts by Branch Access_ (GL103040) 

- _Subaccounts by Branch Access_ (GL103060) 

#### Visibility of Data Within a Branch 

 Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see Multiple Branch Support ). You may need to restrict the visibility of data that is shared but may contain sensitive information, such as general ledger accounts and subaccounts. Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups so you can control which accounts and subaccounts are used with which branch. For details on configuring restriction groups for accounts and subaccounts, see Account and Subaccount Security. 

 Restriction groups configured for branches do not affect the visibility of projects that have these branches specified on the Summary tab of the Projects (PM301000) form. You can manage the visibility of projects to particular users by creating restriction groups on the Project Access (PM102000) form. For more information on configuring access for projects, see Project Security.

## Managing Employees 

 Acumatica ERP provides you with tools for managing your organization's employees. You can maintain the list of employees, specify employee payroll settings and calculate employee cost, manage all organizational processes in which a particular employee is involved, create a user account associated with an employee and set up its access rights in the system, and include employees in workgroups, approval maps, and assignment maps. 

#### In This Section 

- _Employee Settings_ 

- _Company Tree and Workgroups_ 

- _Support of Multiple Work Calendars_ 

### Employee Settings 

 In Acumatica ERP, each employee has a personal employee account with the following groups of settings, each of which is described in more detail in the sections below: 

- _Contact information_ 

- _User account information_ 

- _Employment settings_ 

- _Financial settings_ 

- _Approval settings_ On the _Employee Classes_ (EP202000) form, you can specify default values of some of these settings for an employee class. When you create a new employee on the _Employees_ form, you specify an employee class, and then the system fills in many of the elements on the form with default values provided by the class. 

#### Contact Information 

 When you create an employee on the Employees form, a contact record associated with this employee is created automatically. The name, contact information, and address specified on the General Info tab of the Employees form always match those specified for the related contact on the Contacts (CR302000) form. If you modify these settings for an employee (or a contact), the changes are immediately reflected for the related contact (or an employee). 

#### User Account Information 

 An employee may have an associated user account so that the employee can access Acumatica ERP. On the User Info tab of the Employees form, a system administrator can view and edit information about the user account, create a new user account if none exists, activate, enable, disable, or unlock the user account, assign roles to the existing user, and manage the user's password. 

 For more details about user accounts, see User Access: General Information. 

#### Employment Settings 

 On the Employee Settings tab of the Employees form, you can specify the following settings: 

- The branch with which all transactions related to this employee will be associated 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Employees | 17 

- The calendar that describes the work hours of the employee and the time zone the employee works from     (see _Support of Multiple Work Calendars_ for information about how you can define and maintain multiple     calendars in the system) 

- The requirement for using time cards for the employee (For details about time cards and time reporting, see     _Employee Time Entry: Time Cards_ .) 

- The extent of validation of regular work hours for the employee. The requirements for the hourly rates of the     employee are specified on the **Employee Cost** tab of the _Employees_ form. 

- The non-stock item of the _Labor_ type used as a source of expense accounts for transactions associated     with projects or contracts. You can use the **Labor Item Overrides** tab of the _Employees_ form to define the     relationship between an earning type and a labor item, which is the source of expense accounts. 

 You cannot change the status of your own employee record. 

 On the Employment History tab of the Employees form, you can maintain information about the employee's history of employment in the company. 

#### Financial Settings 

 On the Financial Settings tab of the Employees form, you can specify the accounts involved in the recording of employee compensation and payments, the employee's tax zone, and the payment method to be used by default for compensation payments. 

#### Approval Settings 

 An employee may be assigned as an approver to approve a document or as an owner to process a record. On the Assignment and Approval Maps tab of the Employees form, you can review the list of all assignment and approval maps in which the employee is involved. 

 On the Approvals (EP503010) form, an employee can approve or reject the documents of various types that have the Pending Approval status. Only the following documents are visible to the currently signed-in employee on this form: 

- Those assigned to the employee. 

- Those assigned to other users included in the workgroup to which the employee belongs. 

- Escalated documents assigned to users of workgroups that are at lower levels in the company tree but in     the node of the employee's workgroup. See _Company Tree and Workgroups_ for details about the company     tree. The _Approvals_ form is available only if the _Approval Workflow_ feature is enabled on the _Enable/Disable Features_ (CS100000) form. If the _Approval Workflow_ feature is disabled, no approval of documents can be set up, with an exception of expense claims; in this case, the system assigns an expense claim for approval to the employee specified in the **Reports to** box on the **General Info** tab of the _Employees_ (EP203000) form for the employee who is claiming the expenses; if the **Reports to** box is empty, the claim requires no approval—it is assigned the _Open_ status, and it can be released immediately aer submission. (For more information about the approval of expense claims, see _Expense Claims: Expense Claim Approval_ .) 

 For details about assignment maps, see Managing Assignment Maps and approval maps, see Approval Configuration: Approval Maps. 

### Company Tree and Workgroups 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can build a company tree, which is a model of your organization's hierarchy that includes temporary and permanent workgroups. The company tree may reflect the administrative hierarchy and include subhierarchies of workgroups created within specific branches or departments. The company tree is used for 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Managing Employees | 18 

 creating assignment rules in approval and assignment maps and for determining the scope of the users who want to view items assigned to them. 

#### Company Tree 

 You create a company tree by using the Company Tree (EP204061) form. The company tree serves various purposes in addition to reflecting the administrative structure of your company. The tree doesn't directly include branches, departments, and administrative units within departments, but the tree should include all workgroups that participate in company workflows—for instance, the processing of leads and cases, the resolution of overdue cases, and the approval of various documents, such as time cards, expense claims, and purchase orders. 

 If your company includes multiple branches, consider whether the workflows are completely contained within branches. If they are, for each company branch, create a separate tree branch that arranges the workgroups involved in this organization branch's workflows. If a workgroup of one of the branches participates in workflows of multiple branches, make sure this workgroup is located one level higher on the company tree than other workgroups. Also, make sure the members of this group have access to all the branches involved. 

#### Workgroups and Owners 

 A workgroup includes members who are employees of the company. Acumatica ERP places no restrictions on the number of group members or the number of groups an employee may belong to. A group may include employees with different positions and from different departments. 

 An employee may be a member of more than one workgroup if he or she participates in multiple workflows. For example, an employee might approve purchase orders greater than $1000 and all expense claims. On the other hand, a workgroup may include members from different departments if they participate in the same stage of a specific workflow, such as processing cases. Workgroups participating in the same workflow should be organized in a separate branch on the tree. Your company's tree should have a separate branch for assigning each type of document that can be automatically assigned. 

 One member of the group should be specified as the owner —the user to whom, by default, a new record or document will be assigned once the record or document is assigned to this workgroup. For example, if processing a case involves multiple employees and requires performing research, fixing the product or situation, filling out documents, and performing other activities, the owner can be a team lead who is responsible for the group. If processing a case involves only one person, the workgroup may include only one employee, who will also be its default owner. 

 Also, workgroups can be used for grouping employees by crew. If the Time Reporting on Activity feature is enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, activity time can be reported, approved, and released for an entire crew at a time on the Weekly Crew Time Entry (EP307100), Approve Time Activities (EP507010), and Release Time Activities (EP507020) forms, respectively. For more information about group entry of time activities, see Employee Time Entry: Crew Time. 

#### Workgroups in Assignment and Approval Maps 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can set up automatic assignment of the following entities to workgroups and to particular employees: 

- Records for processing: leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, and cases 

- Documents for approval: expense claims, time cards, purchase orders, sales orders, and other documents This functionality uses assignment maps; it may also use the company tree that contains all workgroups involved in the assignment processes. You don't necessarily have to create a company tree or, if a company tree has been set up, you don't have to always use workgroups in assignment maps because you can specify particular employees as assignees; however, you can create more efficient assignment rules when using a company tree. For each type of document or record that should be automatically assigned, you create any number of assignment maps that define the rules for such assignment, and then, on the related module's preferences form, you specify which assignment map is to be used during the assignment process; for details, see _Managing Assignment Maps_.

### Support of Multiple Work Calendars 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can define and maintain multiple work calendars in the system. Work calendars are used for a variety of purposes, including the following: 

- Labor calculations performed for contracts and projects 

- Effective scheduling of events 

#### Work Calendar Settings 

 Work calendars can be defined on the Work Calendar (CS209000) form. For each employee calendar, you can define the week's work days and specify working hours for each day. On the Exceptions tab, you can define holidays, which preempt work days or shi them to a day when the employee generally does not work, and specify any change in working hours for a particular date. 

#### Employee Calendars 

 On the Employees (EP203000) form, you can associate calendars with particular employees, such as salespeople or members of customer service and support workgroups. If a calendar is to be used by others, the employee should mark his or her calendar as public by using the User Profile (SM203010) form. 

 An employee's calendar can also be used for labor calculation if the employee works in customer support or on projects. Work time and overtime are calculated automatically for time cards when the employee reports time spent on a case or a project task, if billable tasks and activities are used for the service contract or project. 

 To organize work more efficiently, employees who work together should share information about their free and busy times. They can do this in the following ways: 

- In Acumatica ERP, users can export their work calendars, which show their free and busy time, and email     the resulting file to involved persons. 

- Users can export their calendar data from MS Outlook and import it to Acumatica ERP (in .cvs format).     MS Outlook continues to periodically update the .cvs file when changes are made in Outlook. Currently,     changes to the work calendar in Acumatica ERP do not update the calendar file exported to MS Outlook.

 Managing Assignment Maps | 20 

## Managing Assignment Maps 

 Acumatica ERP gives you the capability to automatically assign records (such as leads and cases) to employees for processing, to appropriately distribute work. When assigning a record to an employee, the system follows the rules and conditions specified in a previously created assignment map. 

#### Supported Types of Maps 

 Acumatica ERP supports various types of maps that may include any number of steps, rules, and conditions for assigning a record to a qualified employee for processing or for assigning a document to an authorized employee for approval. Each map has a type, which can be one of the following: 

- _Assignment Map_ : Used for assigning business accounts, cases, contacts, email activities, leads,     opportunities, purchase receipts, requests, or requisitions to owners for further processing. 

- _Assignment and Approval Map_ : Used for either assigning entities to owners or assigning approvers to     documents. Maps of this type were created in earlier versions of Acumatica ERP. This type remains     supported by the system to avoid data loss. By using the **Add Assignment Map** button on the form toolbar of the _Assignment and Approval Maps_ (EP205500) form, you can start creating an assignment map, which opens on a separate entry form. 

#### Assignment Maps 

 Assignment maps are created and modified on the Assignment Maps (EP205010) form. 

 An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. Similarly to a rule in an approval map, a rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met. 

 If you use assignment maps to distribute a particular type of record or document—for instance, to assign cases to different owners who will handle them—be sure to create a complete set of conditions so that no record or document of the specific type is le unassigned. 

 If a condition or rule is no longer required in an assignment map, you can temporarily deactivate it by clearing the Active check box in the settings of that condition or rule on the Assignment Maps form. A deactivated rule is marked with the (Inactive) prefix in the Rules pane. 

 If conditions allow the same documents to be assigned to two or more groups, all assignments will be performed in the group that is positioned higher than the other groups in the assignment map, and the documents would never reach the other groups. 

#### Map Application 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can specify an assignment map for a particular type of record or document by using one of the following forms: 

- _Customer Management Preferences_ (CR101000) for leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and     cases 

- _Assign Request for Information_ (PJ501000) form to assign owners to requests for information Users can assign such records as leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and cases in bulk by using the appropriate mass-processing form, such as _Assign Leads_ (CR503010) or _Assign Cases_ (CR503210).

#### Map Execution Issues 

 Any issues that occur during the execution of an assignment map are recorded in the Acumatica ERP trace log. You can open the trace log by clicking Help > Trace on the form title bar.

 Approvals: Reassignment of Approvals | 22 

## Approvals: Reassignment of Approvals 

 In Acumatica ERP, you can reassign your approval requests to other users or create additional approval requests as exceptions to the normal approval flow on a temporary basis. 

#### Enabling Reassignment of Approvals 

 Approval requests assigned to a particular employee can be reassigned only if the Allow Reassignment of Approvals check box is selected on the Rule Actions tab of the Approval Maps (EP205015) form for the rules in the approval maps that appoint this employee as an original approver. If this check box is cleared for a rule, the system will not allow you to change the approver that has been assigned in accordance with this rule. 

#### Reassigning Approvals 

 To reassign an approval request to another user, first you need to select the approval request on the Approvals (EP503010) form or open the entry form with the record that requires your approval, and then you need to click the Reassign command on the form toolbar. As a result, the Reassign Approval dialog box opens, where you can specify a new approver. 

 If the Ignore Approver's Delegations check box is selected in the dialog box, the system will assign the selected approval requests to the selected new approver but not to their delegate, even if the new approver is unavailable and has a delegation set up for the current date. 

 If the Ignore Approver's Delegations check box is cleared and if the new approver is not available and has a delegation set up for the current date, the system will reassign the selected approval requests to the delegate if the delegate is available. If the delegate is unavailable, the system will reassign the requests to the delegate of the delegate. The system will continue the search in this way until it assigns an approver that has no active delegations set up for the current date or it detects a loop in the chain of delegations (in which case an error message will prompt you to specify a different approver). 

 For more information about delegates, see Approval Configuration: Delegation of Approvals.

 You use the standard buttons on the form toolbar to navigate through entities that were created by using the current form, insert or delete an entity, use the clipboard, save the data you have entered, or cancel your work on the form. 

 A form toolbar on a particular form may include form-specific buttons in addition to standard buttons; it may also (or instead) include commands on the More menu. By using these form-specific buttons and commands, users can navigate to related records and forms, initiate specific actions, and perform modifications or processing related to the functionality of the form. 

#### Standard Form Toolbar Buttons 

 The following table lists the standard buttons of the form toolbar. A form toolbar may include some or all of these buttons. 

 Table: Standard Form Toolbar Buttons 

 Button Icon Description 

 Discard Changes and Close

 If the system opened the current form in a pop-up window (from a different form), this button is not displayed. To return to the original form, click Close. 

 Save & Close Saves the changes made to the entity, and navigates to the list of records that is related to the current form. 

 Save Saves the changes made to the entity. 

 Cancel Depending on the context, does one of the following: 

- Discards any unsaved changes you have made to entities and retrieves the     last saved version. 

- Clears all changes and restores the default settings. 

 Add New Record Clears any values you've specified on the form, restores any default values, and initiates the creation of a new entity. 

 Delete Deletes the currently selected entity, clears any values you have specified on the form, and populates elements with the default values that the system inserts when a new entity is created. 

 You can delete an entity only if it is not linked with another entity.

#### Inquiry Form Toolbar Buttons 

 Acumatica ERP inquiry forms present data in a tabular format; they may also have selection criteria you can use to filter the data in the table. Predefined inquiry forms are provided as part of Acumatica ERP out of the box, and 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 34 

 inquiry forms can be designed by a user with the appropriate access rights by using the Generic Inquiry tool (for details, see Managing Generic Inquiries in the Acumatica ERP Reporting Tools Guide). A form toolbar of an inquiry form contains both the standard form toolbar buttons (described in the table above) and the additional buttons described below. 

 Button Icon Description 

 Refresh Refreshes the inquiry data in the table. 

 Cancel Clears all changes (including selection criteria that has been specified, if the generic inquiry form has this criteria) and restores the default settings. 

 Add New Record Initiates the creation of a new entity. 

 Edit Opens the applicable data entry form with the selected record. 

 Fit to Screen Expands the form to fit on the screen and adjusts the column widths proportionally. 

 Export to Excel Exports the data to an Excel file. For more information, see Integration with Excel in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. 

#### The More Menu and Form-Specific Buttons 

 If there are multiple form-specific commands on the form toolbar, they are displayed on a single menu—the More menu—and listed under descriptive categories, which makes it easier to find the needed menu command. On the More menu, you can easily define your favorite menu commands, which eases access to them. 

 On some forms, the system places a button (which is highlighted in green) on the form toolbar for the expected next command, which represents the likely next step to be performed on the selected record. The following screenshot, which shows the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form, illustrates an example of the form toolbar and the More menu, which contains categories and menu commands. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 35 

 Figure: The form toolbar of the Transactions form 

 The numbered items in the screenshot indicate the following: 

1. A highlighted button for the expected next command, which represents the next logical step to be     performed on the record selected on the form 

2. Another button for a command that is commonly performed on the form 

3. The More button, which you click to open the More menu 

4. The More menu with most form-specific menu commands and descriptive categories on it 

5. The star icon, which is used to mark the individual user's favorite commands on the form 

6. An unavailable command 

#### Favorite Commands 

 Based on your role in the company and your job duties, you may use some commands more oen than others. On the form toolbar, you can specify these commands as favorites. This will cause the system to duplicate the commands as form toolbar buttons, easing access to them. 

 To add a command to the form toolbar as a button, you open the More menu, hover over the needed command, and click the star icon when it appears. The yellow color of the star indicates that the command has been added to your favorites, and a button for the command appears on the form toolbar immediately. The following example shows two commands that have been added to the user's favorites on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form and thus added as buttons on the form toolbar. 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 36 

 Figure: Favorite commands on the More menu and the corresponding toolbar buttons 

 Favorites are individual to each user account, specific to a particular form, and preserved across user sessions. 

#### Highlighted Buttons and Commands 

 On some forms, the system applies predefined logic to commands for specific records. Based on this logic, the system may place a button on the form toolbar, highlight it using some color, or do both of these things. 

 If a command is the expected next command (that is, the command that is most likely to be clicked for a record with the current status), it is shown both on the form toolbar and on the More menu. The primary command on the form toolbar is highlighted in green (see Item 1 in the following screenshot), and on the More menu, it is marked with a green dot (Item 2). Below is an example of a cash transaction on the Cash Transactions (CA304000) form that has the On Hold status (Item 3). Before you can process it, you need to remove it from hold. Because Remove Hold is the next logical command, it is displayed as a button on the form toolbar and highlighted in green. 

 Figure: The highlighted command and the corresponding status 


<!-- PAGE_BREAK -->
 Appendix | 37 

#### Unavailable Commands on the More Menu 

 By default, on the More menu, the system displays all commands that could be available for the form, based on the system configuration. Some of these commands may be unavailable (that is, they are listed but cannot be clicked). These are the commands that are not applicable to the record based on its current status or other factors. 

#### The Responsive Form Toolbar and More Menu 

 The form toolbar and the More menu have a responsive layout, meaning that they dynamically adjust to different screen sizes. When there is enough space, buttons for highlighted and favorite commands are displayed on the form toolbar. When the screen size decreases, the system moves the commands off the form toolbar one by one but keeps them on the More menu. 

 If there are multiple categories on the More menu, the categories and menu commands can be displayed in multiple columns on the More menu, depending on the screen size and the number of categories. When the screen size decreases, the system moves some categories and menu commands to the le to decrease the number of columns, and in the screens of the smallest size, all categories are displayed in one column. Below are two examples of the same menu in different screen sizes for a record on the Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form.
